Can you come back in about an hour?"," Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.

" Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens."," No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.", L239574, L239573,m75
 Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.," Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.

" You'll never regret this, Ray."," My parents left me that house, I was born there.", L239652, L239651,m75

" It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce"," But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.", L406485, L406484,m144
" My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to."," I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.", L406487, L406486,m144
" It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies."," I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.", L406489, L406488,m144
" Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail."," I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.", L406493, L406492,m144
" I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait."," Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?", L406538, L406537,m144
" Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.", I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation, L406540, L406539,m144
" If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion."," General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.", L406542, L406541,m144
" I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.", Proceed., L406544, L406543,m144
" But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death."," You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.", L406546, L406545,m144
 I have heard that story but I do not believe it.," Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.", L406548, L406547,m144
" The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time."," For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.", L406550, L406549,m144
" Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?"," Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.", L406552, L406551,m144
" You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that."," I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.", L406554, L406553,m144
" Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it."," Ah, yes -- proceed.", L406556, L406555,m144
" Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground."," I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?", L406560, L406559,m144
" Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter."," Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?", L406562, L406561,m144
" I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again."," Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.", L406564, L406563,m144
 Proceed.," If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow.  When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty.  When Berlin fell, another treaty.  That has always been the rules of the game.  But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming?  He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness.", L406566, L406565,m144
 What do you think Napoleon will do?," I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.", L406568, L406567,m144
" If he withdraws his army in good order, it will be a serious political defeat.  But, if he should be caught on the move, with his army, in the full grip of winter, then it will be a catastrophe.  If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence, be deceit, by any means, for another month, thus postponing his departure, then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of Russia."," General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.", L406570, L406569,m144
" And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander."," And, what a delightful idea!", L406368, L406367,m144
 Ah -- you approve?, I think it's absolutely charming., L406370, L406369,m144
 I'm glad you like it., Whatever suggested the idea to you?, L406372, L406371,m144
" You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.  When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down."," Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?", L406381, L406380,m144
" Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. ""Berthier sees only what is in the open,"" Murat said.  ""But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest.""  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment."," Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.", L406383, L406382,m144

" We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.", What do you have in mind?, L405968, L405967,m144
" To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.", Are you serious?, L405970, L405969,m144
 I don't even know whether a defense is possible., What forces do you have at your disposal?, L405972, L405971,m144
" About 5,000 troops.", Cavalry?, L405974, L405973,m144
" The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.", Any cannon?, L405976, L405975,m144
 There are none here., Where are they?, L405978, L405977,m144
" Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.", You could have them here by daybreak., L405980, L405979,m144
" Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?"," Properly arranged, yes.", L405982, L405981,m144
 These are odds of 8 to 1.," The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.", L405984, L405983,m144
 Would you be prepared to handle this for me?, Are you proposing to transfer command to me?, L405986, L405985,m144
" In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.", Fair enough., L405988, L405987,m144
" I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.", I'm not insulted., L405990, L405989,m144
 You realize what is at stake?," Our lives, the revolution, my career?", L405992, L405991,m144

 And who is defending Paris?," Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.", L406601, L406600,m144
 Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.," Unhappily, it is true, sire.", L406603, L406602,m144
 But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?," The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet.  Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.", L406605, L406604,m144
" But, sire, Your Majesty would lay Paris open to being sacked.  The enemy is outside the gates with more than 120,000 men.  Besides this, I left the city under the terms of a treaty and I am forbidden to reenter Paris.", A treaty?  Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this?  Who made it? Who has been giving orders?, L406610, L406609,m144
" I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.", But who made this treaty?, L406612, L406611,m144
 I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position., Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?, L406614, L406613,m144

 Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life., It is a terrible shock., L406634, L406633,m144
 But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?," I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.", L406636, L406635,m144
 She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.  They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me?  Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper?  How incredible!, That is incredible., L406638, L406637,m144
" Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.

 Shall we move closer to the fire?, Yes -- an excellent idea., L406343, L406342,m144
 Will Alexander be joining us soon?, I very much doubt that he will., L406345, L406344,m144
 Oh...?, I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle., L406347, L406346,m144
" But he asked me to say...  on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his...  admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven...  and that his army..."," My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.", L406350, L406349,m144
" I'm afraid I am, just a bit.", Would you like some brandy?, L406352, L406351,m144
 Thank you., I'll have the fire built up., L406354, L406353,m144
" Thank you, Napoleon."," Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?", L406357, L406356,m144
 No -- not as a rule.," Ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare.  You must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear.  You can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom.", L406359, L406358,m144
" Good evening, sir."," Good evening, Mademoiselle.", L405875, L405874,m144
" The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?"," Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.", L405877, L405876,m144
" You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this."," Yes, I am, sir.", L405880, L405879,m144
 Then what brings you out on such a night?," Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.", L405882, L405881,m144
" Oh, I see... That must be a great burden."," One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?", L405884, L405883,m144
" No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence."," Are you staying with a friend, sir?", L405886, L405885,m144
 No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.," Is it a nice warm room, sir?", L405888, L405887,m144
" Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street."," Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?", L405890, L405889,m144
" Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money."," Do you have three francs, sir?", L405892, L405891,m144
" Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice."," Oh, I'm sorry about that.", L405894, L405893,m144
 What's your name?, Lisette., L405896, L405895,m144
 Only Lisette?, Lisette La Croix., L405898, L405897,m144
 That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?," Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.", L405900, L405899,m144
 I would like both of you to read this.  Please read it aloud.," To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife.  You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.", L406081, L406080,m144
" Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?", No..., L406083, L406082,m144
 No... nothing at all., Not even the slightest hint of something?, L406088, L406087,m144
" No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other."," You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?", L406090, L406089,m144
" Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this."," And you, Junot?", L406092, L406091,m144
" The important thing is to find the right lawyer.  One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the courts."," You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.", L406184, L406183,m144
 I know of no better time., You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce., L406186, L406185,m144
 The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already., You must not act impetuously., L406188, L406187,m144
 It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us., But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life., L406190, L406189,m144
 Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?, Are you trying to insult me?, L406193, L406192,m144
" Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder."," Well, you shall see.", L406195, L406194,m144
 When is she supposed to return?," I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.", L406197, L406196,m144
 She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.," My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.", L406199, L406198,m144
 Will you use the troops?, Only as a last resort.  What are the Councils doing now?, L406251, L406250,m144
" Ah, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child, at last.  I was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the Empress."," I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.", L406465, L406464,m144
 Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?," I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.", L406467, L406466,m144
" Ah, that is good."," And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.", L406469, L406468,m144
" Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down."," Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.", L406028, L406027,m144
" Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?"," Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.", L406030, L406029,m144
 May I offer you a drink?," Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.", L406032, L406031,m144
" Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here."," You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?", L406034, L406033,m144
" I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon."," Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.", L406039, L406038,m144
 Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?," No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.", L406044, L406043,m144
 Were you in love with him?, I thought I was.  I was confused., L406201, L406200,m144
 And now?," Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.", L406203, L406202,m144
 Do you expect me to believe that?, Yes., L406205, L406204,m144
" And you, are you in love with any one else?", No., L406207, L406206,m144
 But you have had mistresses while you were away., Of course., L406209, L406208,m144
 Were you in love with any of them?, No., L406211, L406210,m144
 Were they pretty?, Yes., L406213, L406212,m144
 Were any of them prettier than I am?, One had better legs., L406215, L406214,m144
 Were any of them married?, Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting., L406217, L406216,m144
 She must have been in love with you.," Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.", L406219, L406218,m144
 Promise me you will never leave me., I cannot promise you that., L406221, L406220,m144
 Promise me., I will never forgive you., L406223, L406222,m144
" I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.", I don't understand you., L406225, L406224,m144
 Promise., Promises mean nothing., L406227, L406226,m144
" Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.", All right -- I promise., L406229, L406228,m144
 Yes -- what is it?, Open the door.  It's me., L406298, L406297,m144
 Go away -- I'm busy., I know what you're doing in there., L406300, L406299,m144
 Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working., Where is Madame Trillaud?, L406302, L406301,m144
 How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress., What are you doing in there?, L406304, L406303,m144
" Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once."," Will you be joining us, soon?", L406306, L406305,m144
 I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests., Five minutes., L406308, L406307,m144
 Yes!!, Five minutes., L406310, L406309,m144
 Separate bedrooms?, Yes., L406320, L406319,m144
 But you will not... be safe..., Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?, L406322, L406321,m144
 Who is it?, It's me., L406325, L406324,m144
 I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.," Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.", L406329, L406328,m144
" Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins."," Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.", L406331, L406330,m144
" No, one cannot simply ignore it."," I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.", L406086, L406085,m144
 I believe you sent for me.," Yes, yes, please sit down.  I will be with you in a moment.", L406104, L406103,m144
" God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?", There's probably some explanation., L406110, L406109,m144
" Well, anyway, sorry to call you away from the festivities, but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles?  I asked for it yesterday.", I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon., L406113, L406112,m144
 Why did you give it to him?," I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.", L406115, L406114,m144
" Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier."," I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.", L406117, L406116,m144
 I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?, He's downstairs -- somewhere., L406119, L406118,m144
" Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?", Certainly., L406122, L406121,m144
 I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph., Why not?, L406124, L406123,m144
" Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.", What are you talking about?, L406126, L406125,m144
 Nothing.  That's all I can say., That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?, L406128, L406127,m144
 That's all I can say.," Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.", L406130, L406129,m144
" Look, Junot, you aren't going to leave this room until you explain yourself.", There are some things... better left unsaid., L406133, L406132,m144
 What the hell is the matter with you?, I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you., L406136, L406135,m144
" Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!", You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?, L406138, L406137,m144
 Yes., I wrote it., L406140, L406139,m144
 What?," Yes, I wrote it.", L406142, L406141,m144
 You wrote it., I couldn't face telling you., L406144, L406143,m144
 You couldn't face telling me what?, About Hippolyte Charles., L406146, L406145,m144
 What was there to tell?," My God, what do you think?", L406148, L406147,m144
 Do you know what you're saying?, God help me -- yes., L406150, L406149,m144
 How do you know?, I know., L406152, L406151,m144
" I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.", Yes?, L406155, L406154,m144
 You could hear them?, Yes., L406158, L406157,m144
 You mean you heard them making love?, Yes., L406160, L406159,m144
 How did you know it was Captain Charles?," I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.", L406162, L406161,m144
" Can you give me a drink, please?"," Yes, of course.  What do you want?", L406164, L406163,m144
 I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself., And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?, L406166, L406165,m144
" Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?"," My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.", L406475, L406474,m144
" Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?"," No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.", L406477, L406476,m144
" May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me."," Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.", L406479, L406478,m144
" If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?"," If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.", L406481, L406480,m144
" Good evening, ladies.  You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you."," Oh, then you are...", L406433, L406432,m144
" And, where did you see my portrait?"," Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.", L406437, L406436,m144
" And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?"," You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.", L406440, L406439,m144
 Do you like music?," Yes, I do -- very much.", L406443, L406442,m144
 Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.," Of course, my dear.", L406445, L406444,m144
 You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?," You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.", L406447, L406446,m144
 I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside., I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside., L406449, L406448,m144
" I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn."," I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.", L406451, L406450,m144
" Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much."," Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.", L406453, L406452,m144
" Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.", Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?, L406455, L406454,m144
 Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.," Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything.  I will teach you everything that you must know.", L406457, L406456,m144
 Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?, No., L406459, L406458,m144
" Article 46, calls for the virtual dismemberment of Prussia, reducing her population by half and her army to a token force.", Does she deserve anything better?, L406388, L406387,m144
 Those are extremely harsh terms., I did not ask her to go to war against me., L406390, L406389,m144
 Has Alexander agreed to this?," Yes, he has.", L406392, L406391,m144
" Now, the section headed ""Secret Clauses of the Treaty"" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade.", That is correct., L406394, L406393,m144
 Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?," I very seriously doubt it.  I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse.  More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.", L406396, L406395,m144
 England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard., We have a treaty with Austria., L406398, L406397,m144
" Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses."," My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.", L406400, L406399,m144
 What I am talking about is moderation.," What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.", L406402, L406401,m144
 And where do you place Alexander?, Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding., L406404, L406403,m144
" I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.", That is a matter of opinion., L406406, L406405,m144
" Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.", He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do., L406408, L406407,m144
 Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?," I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?", L405904, L405903,m144
" A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin."," You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.", L405908, L405907,m144
" Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone."," No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you.  Now, will you please come down at once.  You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.", L405910, L405909,m144
" Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform."," Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart.", L405912, L405911,m144
 I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.," Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.", L405915, L405914,m144
 What did you say his name was?, Eugene de Beauharnais., L406002, L406001,m144
 Is he alone?," Yes, sir.", L406004, L406003,m144
 Come in.," Major Lavallette to see you, General.", L406246, L406245,m144

 Come in.," Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.", L406261, L406260,m144
" Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.", My mother has always loved me.  She would do anything for me., L405854, L405853,m144
 His moods at this time were complex and varied., Life is a burden for me.  Nothing gives me any pleasure, L405871, L405870,m144
" He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline."," It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together.", L405873, L405872,m144
" Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him."," From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.", L406062, L406061,m144
" On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.

 Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!," Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!", L45948, L45947,m245
 I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!, Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?, L45950, L45949,m245
" Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!"," Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.", L45953, L45952,m245
" <u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!"," Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.", L45955, L45954,m245
 Worker!  Come back here now!, I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>., L45957, L45956,m245
 Water...water...," Water...water -- oh, you already said that.", L45977, L45976,m245
" My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life."," <u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was <u>happily miserable</u>.", L45979, L45978,m245
 We're going to die!, Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?, L45982, L45981,m245
 Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?, Want a list?, L45985, L45984,m245
 This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!, Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap., L45990, L45989,m245
 Out here I'm just what?, Hlllllllp!, L45993, L45992,m245
" Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?", General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee., L45998, L45997,m245
 Look.  How many other Princesses are there?, Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now., L46000, L45999,m245
 And only you can become a Queen?," Well...no, but --", L46002, L46001,m245
 So what makes you so special?, Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest., L46004, L46003,m245
" Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...", Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced., L46038, L46037,m245
 We've found it!  <u>Insectopia</u>!  Look at all this food'," You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!", L46042, L46041,m245
 Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know...., Yes?, L46078, L46077,m245
" Come on, Z."," Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. ""Insectopia"".", L46094, L46093,m245
 So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?," Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.", L46111, L46110,m245
" Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...", You held onto this all that time?, L46114, L46113,m245
 Why do they have you tied up here?," There's something going on, Z --", L46176, L46175,m245
" Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!", Oh no..., L46179, L46178,m245
 Z!  what are you doing?," I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.", L46181, L46180,m245
" I mean, I've got the whole package, right?  A great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids.", A <u>few</u>?, L46263, L46262,m245
 The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  I want to try someplace different., There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar., L45692, L45691,m245
 We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!," I'm the Princess, aren't I?", L45717, L45716,m245
 Of course --, And do Princesses do improper things?, L45719, L45718,m245
 Of course not --," Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.", L45721, L45720,m245
" Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General."," It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?", L45667, L45666,m245
 I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared., You did?, L45682, L45681,m245
 Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood., Yes...he's wonderful..., L45684, L45683,m245
 Who is that idiot?," Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!", L45794, L45793,m245
 Bala!, Mom!, L46192, L46191,m245
" You new, kid?", I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!, L45798, L45797,m245
" You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?"," Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?", L45803, L45802,m245
 No -- we're going to attack the termites!, Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!, L45805, L45804,m245
" Well, what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork?", Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle!, L45811, L45810,m245
" So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!"," Superior numbers, kid!", L45814, L45813,m245
" Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.", Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home., L45819, L45818,m245
 BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!, Don't get all sappy about it!, L45826, L45825,m245

 Barbatus!," Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?", L45841, L45840,m245
" No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks."," No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...", L45843, L45842,m245
" Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!", I wonder...what...was it all...for..., L45845, L45844,m245
" Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!"," Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...", L45847, L45846,m245
" Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.", Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?, L45664, L45663,m245
" Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds available right now.", Outstanding.  Princess...?, L45674, L45673,m245
" Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.", Duty calls!, L45679, L45678,m245
" Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!"," I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!", L46008, L46007,m245
" Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?"," Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?", L46013, L46012,m245
" What do we have on this ""Insectopia""?"," Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.", L46033, L46032,m245
 Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six., Ant Team Six..., L46035, L46034,m245
" What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!  Come on, you yellow-bellies!  Don't just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of yourself!"," Uh, actually, we <u>are</u> outnumbered sir...", L46250, L46249,m245
 So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?," Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.", L46016, L46015,m245
" Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?"," Oh, no, sir!", L46018, L46017,m245
 Good.  You're a good soldier.," Thank you, sir.", L46020, L46019,m245
 So tell me.  Where's Z?," I...I have no idea, sir.", L46022, L46021,m245
" We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  We know that no ant can be an individual.  No <u>single</u> ant matters, right?"," That's correct, sir!", L46025, L46024,m245
 Not that one.  Or that one.," No, sir!", L46027, L46026,m245
" Lays it on a little thick, doesn't he?  If you ask me, he's one giant bore."," Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.

 Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?, Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you., L45872, L45871,m245
" Son, you're an ant after my own heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks death right in the face and <u>laughs</u>."," Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back.  So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?", L45877, L45876,m245
 Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!, Engaged?  As in you're getting married?, L45879, L45878,m245
 Affirmative., So...you two are in love?, L45881, L45880,m245
" Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony."," Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?", L45884, L45883,m245
 ...Not enough food?," Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.", L45886, L45885,m245
" Well I, I don't think ""living it up"" is the right term -- how about ""working themselves to death""?"," I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...", L45888, L45887,m245
 May I cut in?," Oh, of course --", L45903, L45902,m245
 What's this?  A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!," Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --", L45920, L45919,m245
 ARREST HIM!, Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --, L45922, L45921,m245
" General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?", We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory..., L45656, L45655,m245
" Yes, what else?"," Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.", L45658, L45657,m245
 No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?," I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?", L45660, L45659,m245

" 'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty."," Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!", L46187, L46186,m245
" I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've got abandonment issues.  My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.  I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker.  But I don't have any other options.

 Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.," And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.", L45708, L45707,m245

 It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?," What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!", L45766, L45765,m245

 And where am I gonna be?," In the parking lot, with her.", L61442, L61441,m253

" Yeah, explode it up your ass!"," Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.", L60952, L60951,m253

" The power of a million hydrogen bombs!  ...and we get twenty four measly volts. It's not fair!

 Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!, Is Shemp all right?, L61079, L61078,m253

 You answered the door!, You were ringing the doorbell!, L61242, L61241,m253
 I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?, What if you lost your keys?, L61244, L61243,m253
 Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!," Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?", L61246, L61245,m253
" Let me put it on a level you can understand. You don't belong here. You don't know anything about this world. You don't know the customs, you don't know how to talk, how to act -- you don't even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street, you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested.

" Look, it's not a big deal! I can fix it! All I gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!"," You better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. And if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. If they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. If they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!", L61376, L61375,m253
 Where did you get this?, I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book., L61412, L61411,m253
" The test is this Monday! 15 megatons... Let's see, we need 4200 rads...  You'd have to be...exactly 800 yards from ground zero...

" Your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday, she's available."," But that's impossible!! George asked her out! He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!", L61419, L61418,m253
 My guess is that she turned him down., But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!, L61421, L61420,m253
" Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.", Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?, L61423, L61422,m253
" In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.", Jesus!, L61425, L61424,m253
 That's all taken care of.," Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.", L61462, L61461,m253
" Look. I'm a little worried about this -- this whole thing with my mother, he admitted to the Professor. I mean, I don't know if I can do it -- I mean, hitting on my own mother, that's pretty heavy.", Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her., L61464, L61463,m253
" That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?"," Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.", L61466, L61465,m253
 That's just what I needed to hear.," It'll be fine, Marty.  You'll be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there was still a question that was nagging at him...", L61468, L61467,m253

 You didn't?, Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!, L61541, L61540,m253
 It was sure nice of Uncle Sam to put those yardage markers up for us. ," We're at one and a half miles, so you're just a little over a mile from where you want to be,  Wait until minus 3 minutes before you go -- that should give you plenty of time, and it should be close enough to zero hour that they can't do anything to stop you. Park the truck at 800 and get in the refri-- the time chamber. Just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bomb....the power converter will do the rest.", L61561, L61560,m253
" Thanks for everything, Pro.", Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years., L61566, L61565,m253
" Marty,  I know I've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future, but....well, those loud bangs on the tape recorder....are they...."," Professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.", L61571, L61570,m253
 What year is this?," 1982! March 18, just like we planned! My calculations were absolutely correct! Thirty years! God, I cannot believe it's been thirty years! Sure, it was a long time ago -- longest I've ever had to wait for the results of an experiment!", L61639, L61638,m253

" You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky.

Time travel bans? What the hell?, L61648, L61647,m253
" But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?"," According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies.

 Our destruction?  Who?, The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing., L192095, L192094,m337

" But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.", Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset., L192099, L192098,m337

 That's right., You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you., L191601, L191600,m337

" You, too, golden rod.", I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior., L191988, L191987,m337

 That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind., Does Luke know?, L191609, L191608,m337
" He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ...

 Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss., I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee., L191622, L191621,m337
" There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.", We are fighting for a cause much ..., L191624, L191623,m337
 Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet., And you think you're the one to apply some heat?, L191626, L191625,m337
" Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han, I don't know how ...", Forget it., L191688, L191687,m337

 .... I'm afraid there's not much left., What was it?, L191713, L191712,m337
 Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ...., An Imperial probe droid., L191715, L191714,m337
" Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.", I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from., L191759, L191758,m337
 I don't know what he's talking about., Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet., L191765, L191764,m337
 You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.," Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?", L191769, L191768,m337
" Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder."," Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?", L191771, L191770,m337
 Hey!  Someone's still in here.," Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.", L191851, L191850,m337
 Would it help if I got out and pushed?," Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.", L191869, L191868,m337
 This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade., This baby's got a few surprises left in her., L191873, L191872,m337
" I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?", Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us., L191893, L191892,m337
 That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ...., Or you ran into something ...., L191919, L191918,m337
" Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...", Probably an asteroid field ...., L191921, L191920,m337
 Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need., To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?, L191923, L191922,m337

 That Star Destroyer is slowing down., Good., L191936, L191935,m337
 But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer., I'm against that., L191938, L191937,m337
 We've got to get out of this shower., Now you're making sense., L191940, L191939,m337
" There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.", What is it?, L191946, L191945,m337
" Why, Princess, this is so sudden.", Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry., L191976, L191975,m337
 You don't look angry., How do I look?, L191978, L191977,m337
" Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited."," Well, I hope you don't expect more.", L191982, L191981,m337
" I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.", Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go., L191984, L191983,m337
 That was no earthquake., Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser., L192031, L192030,m337
 They're moving away., They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe., L192034, L192033,m337
" Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.", Would you please stop calling me that?, L192039, L192038,m337
 Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.," Yes, you do.", L192041, L192040,m337
" Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.", That's quite a compliment., L192044, L192043,m337
 Stop that., Why?, L192046, L192045,m337
 What are you afraid of?, Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy., L192049, L192048,m337
 Don't count on it.  I happen to like nice men.," Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.", L192053, L192052,m337
 There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized., You mean a man you can control., L192055, L192054,m337

 That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.," I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.", L192368, L192367,m337
 No., Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here., L192370, L192369,m337

" Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.", Not true., L402838, L402837,m451
 Have you ever kissed anyone?, Like they do on TV?, L402840, L402839,m451
 Uh huh., No., L402842, L402841,m451
" Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal."," But, I don't know how.", L402844, L402843,m451
 Like this?," Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.", L402847, L402846,m451
 Close your eyes., But then I won't be able to see anything., L402849, L402848,m451
 Just do it.," Okay, okay.", L402851, L402850,m451
 Say something it's too quiet.," Umm, Ummmmm", L402858, L402857,m451
 You better not either.," Well, let's spit on it.", L402864, L402863,m451
 Seeya tomorrow.," Okay, seeya.  Vada?", L402867, L402866,m451
 What?, Would you think of me?, L402869, L402868,m451
 For what?, Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler., L402871, L402870,m451
" Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?", I'm fine., L410616, L410615,m457
 Let me get you another glass of wine., I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?, L410619, L410618,m457
 They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?, Of course., L410621, L410620,m457
 Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?, No. I only needed the code from you., L410753, L410752,m457
 Take this off.," He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.", L410757, L410756,m457
 You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste..., My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me., L410761, L410760,m457
" She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?", She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware., L410733, L410732,m457
 Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party., Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them., L410742, L410741,m457
 You're hurt..., It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here., L410794, L410793,m457
 What about her?, Of course..., L410796, L410795,m457
 What are you doing in here?," The Elders, mon...", L410565, L410564,m457
 Can you get us into Straylight?, Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of., L410671, L410670,m457
 I'm getting used to it. Where are we?, Straylight. Kitchen dock., L410717, L410716,m457
 What the hell is that?, Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon., L410728, L410727,m457
" What you lookin' for, mon?", A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen., L410747, L410746,m457
 Ghost a steppin' razor..., No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close., L410782, L410781,m457
 Easy...," Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.", L410229, L410228,m457
 What's an A.I., An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable., L410234, L410233,m457
" A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?"," He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.", L410476, L410475,m457
 We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.," They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.", L410534, L410533,m457
" The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.", How's the villa's security?, L410542, L410541,m457
 Alright. Let's talk business., Why not?, L410502, L410501,m457
 Those are all your records. I can have you cleared on all counts. Possession. ...Contributing to the delinquency of minors... Statutory rape., I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen., L410509, L410508,m457
" Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer."," You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.", L410517, L410516,m457
 Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you., And how do you suggest I do that?, L410547, L410546,m457
" Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.", You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is., L410159, L410158,m457
" The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.", What does this have to do with me?, L410164, L410163,m457
" Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.", Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf., L410166, L410165,m457
" If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.", My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else., L410169, L410168,m457
 What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?, I'd say you were full of shit., L410171, L410170,m457
 Then I'd ask you what your terms are.," First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.", L410173, L410172,m457
 It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?, We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance., L410175, L410174,m457
" Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?", Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many., L410177, L410176,m457
 I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.," I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.", L410222, L410221,m457
" You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain."," Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.", L410224, L410223,m457
" There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.", You son of a bitch..., L410227, L410226,m457
" Why'd you do it, Armitage?", The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I., L410231, L410230,m457
" First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.", This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus., L410236, L410235,m457
 Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct., It hasn't yet., L410238, L410237,m457
" I've heard about rogue A.I.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.", Dixie McCoy, L410240, L410239,m457
 Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know., I've arranged for him to work with us., L410242, L410241,m457
 That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.," I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?", L410244, L410243,m457
 What are you talking about?, Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's., L410246, L410245,m457
" Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else."," You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.", L410248, L410247,m457
 And then?," Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.", L410250, L410249,m457
 You ran without us., I cannot tell a lie. Sorry., L410331, L410330,m457
" Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.", What's he doing to my gear?, L410333, L410332,m457
 What's this?, Could be your A.I.'s calling card., L410338, L410337,m457
 Did you trace it?," No, but it traced me.", L410340, L410339,m457
 Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear., What about McCoy?, L410342, L410341,m457
" He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?", Prepping your trip., L410344, L410343,m457
 Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.," Offworld. The A.I.... this ""Wintermute"" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.", L410346, L410345,m457
" That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.", You'll be linked during the entire operation., L410348, L410347,m457
" Yeah, well it's working.", Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn., L410356, L410355,m457
 Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream., You see the couple up in the balcony?, L410469, L410468,m457
 That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa., He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?, L410471, L410470,m457
 Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier., The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?, L410473, L410472,m457
" That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.", We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night., L410538, L410537,m457
 Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake., Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?, L410594, L410593,m457
" As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.", What are you talking about?, L410596, L410595,m457
 You've got your orders.," This ain't Bangkok, chief.", L410600, L410599,m457
 You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes., I find out now., L410607, L410606,m457
" An odd selection, Mr Case.", I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest., L410695, L410694,m457
 Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil., Can you read my mind?, L410697, L410696,m457
" You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote ""Wintermute"".", Are you even really alive?, L410702, L410701,m457
 Tell me the words., The words?, L410706, L410705,m457
 The access code to your mainframe.," Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.", L410708, L410707,m457
" What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?"," Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.", L410710, L410709,m457
 Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.," It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.", L410712, L410711,m457
" Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?"," Fine, Ratz. Thanks.", L410095, L410094,m457
 I saw your girl yesterday., I don't have a girl., L410100, L410099,m457
" Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic", You're pleasant tonight., L410103, L410102,m457
" Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?", Yeah., L410105, L410104,m457
" Hey, bro.", It's Case. Remember me?, L410294, L410293,m457
" Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?"," Fine, Dixie. Fine.", L410296, L410295,m457
 Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it., Yeah. That was me., L410298, L410297,m457
" Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura."," As far as they know, that's absolutely true.", L410300, L410299,m457
" Ya learned good. So, what's happening?", That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?, L410302, L410301,m457
 Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...," Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?", L410304, L410303,m457
" Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct."," Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.", L410306, L410305,m457
 What elders?, Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside., L410572, L410571,m457
 She's ready to go.," Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.", L410610, L410609,m457
 Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?, All things possible in Babylon., L410612, L410611,m457
" So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze."," I an' I, man. I an' I.", L410674, L410673,m457
 We're doing fine. Take the next right.," This place empty as a tomb, mon.", L410766, L410765,m457
" Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.", The girl 3Jane. We need her., L410787, L410786,m457
 Four men. Babylon soldiers., Can you walk?, L410890, L410889,m457
 Ready?," I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.", L410895, L410894,m457
 Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?," Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.", L410901, L410900,m457
" Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.", Jah guides us., L410905, L410904,m457
 What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?, Right..., L410312, L410311,m457
 I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine., You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special., L410314, L410313,m457
" Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?", What?, L410316, L410315,m457

 Who got you into this?, A guy who calls himself Armitage., L410375, L410374,m457
 Never heard of him., Nobody has., L410377, L410376,m457
 I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?," No problem, amigo.", L410379, L410378,m457
" What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it."," Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.", L410381, L410380,m457

 Yo., How are we doing?, L410425, L410424,m457
 That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web., Can you take me to it?, L410427, L410426,m457

 Bright enough to be dangerous., That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe., L410553, L410552,m457
" He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.", Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him., L410555, L410554,m457
 It's possible. The guy was a blank slate., So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense., L410557, L410556,m457
 Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs., No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful., L410559, L410558,m457
" Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it."," The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?", L410561, L410560,m457

" Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?", We run. You crack the pattern?, L410678, L410677,m457
" Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.", You can make your move when it comes after me., L410680, L410679,m457
 What are you talkin' about?, I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix., L410682, L410681,m457
 It'll flatline your ass., Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?, L410685, L410684,m457
 Yo., How's the ice break?, L410769, L410768,m457
 Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.," How long, Dixie?", L410772, L410771,m457
 Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.," Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.", L410774, L410773,m457
 How much time you got left?, Less than thirty minutes., L410776, L410775,m457

 You haven't got it?," I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.", L410845, L410844,m457

 What about the route to the core?, I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive., L410858, L410857,m457
" You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...", Case., L410497, L410496,m457
 What about the mainframe's access code?, 3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code., L410545, L410544,m457
 Wait... You hear that?, What?, L410806, L410805,m457
 Want to fucking answer them?, No!... No..., L410810, L410809,m457
" Hello, Case.", I thought you already left., L410107, L410106,m457
" Why did you come here tonight, Linda?", People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you., L410110, L410109,m457
 I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me., This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score., L410112, L410111,m457
 Where did you here that?," Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.", L410114, L410113,m457
 Case... are you okay?, I don't know. I don't know..., L410877, L410876,m457
 I know who you are.," There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.", L410439, L410438,m457
 And we really do have to talk., You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed., L410441, L410440,m457
 I had to limit your options., And Linda..., L410443, L410442,m457
 You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.," I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.", L410445, L410444,m457

 You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment., That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value., L443242, L443241,m473
 Hmph., The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals., L443244, L443243,m473

" State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.", Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image, L443464, L443463,m473

" Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.", Be it so ordered.

" Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?"," I admit, I know nothing of your culture.", L443475, L443474,m473
 Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.," Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.", L443477, L443476,m473
" Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?", Show this to the President., L443479, L443478,m473
" Good morning, Dr. Zira."," Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?", L443251, L443250,m473

 Did you see that? It's remarkable!, Huh?, L443264, L443263,m473
 He's trying to form words.," Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.", L443266, L443265,m473

 Landon! Join the expedition., Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?, L443144, L443143,m473
 Air leak. Died in her sleep., You don't seem very cut up about it., L443146, L443145,m473

" Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis.

 Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing," Climb off me, will you!", L443178, L443177,m473
" And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.", Taylor., L443180, L443179,m473
 Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?, Don't bother, L443183, L443182,m473
 Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative., But I'm not prepared to die., L443185, L443184,m473

 Who are you?, So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --, L443578, L443577,m473
 She comes along too., Zira doesn't want your female., L443582, L443581,m473
 I want her., If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --, L443584, L443583,m473
 Shouldn't we be moving on?, I'm for that., L443653, L443652,m473
 Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?, In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair., L443659, L443658,m473
" Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.", Always giving orders. Just like every other adult., L443693, L443692,m473
" Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel, Lucius?", Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --, L443734, L443733,m473
" All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.", What is it?, L443736, L443735,m473
 I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.," Yes, I can do that.", L443738, L443737,m473
 They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?, I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose., L443762, L443761,m473
 Lucius., I think you're making a mistake., L443780, L443779,m473
 That's the boy. Keep 'em flying., What?, L443782, L443781,m473
 I told you not to bring the other one., He wouldn't leave her., L443587, L443586,m473
 Gorilla hunters ..., Keep moving. We can't turn back now., L443592, L443591,m473
 Who put them up?, The Hunt Club., L443639, L443638,m473
 What is that?," A man, Dr. Maximus.", L443379, L443378,m473
" Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.", Why special?, L443382, L443381,m473
 You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here., My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation., L443444, L443443,m473
" And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him."," At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.", L443446, L443445,m473
 Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down., My name is Taylor., L443459, L443458,m473
 It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself., This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story..., L443461, L443460,m473
 One is in a museum!, Dr. Zira! Silence that man!, L443494, L443493,m473
" You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!", Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!, L443514, L443513,m473
" Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius."," By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.", L443442, L443441,m473
" Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.", Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something., L443454, L443453,m473
 That╒s a lie!," Mind your tongue, madame.", L443470, L443469,m473
" Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.", Read it yourself., L443481, L443480,m473
" 'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained...""", Stop right there. Bring me that paper., L443483, L443482,m473
 This is a joke in very poor taste., Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?, L443485, L443484,m473
 How so?," Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.", L443526, L443525,m473
 Sustained.," Sustain all objections, but face the truth!", L443532, L443531,m473
 Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?, With one of them., L443504, L443503,m473
 What about me?," Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?", L443543, L443542,m473
 No.," Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.", L443545, L443544,m473
" However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.", I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours., L443547, L443546,m473
 You lied. Where is your tribe?," My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.", L443549, L443548,m473
" Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?", What about it?, L443551, L443550,m473
" A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?", I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira., L443553, L443552,m473
 Certainly not.," That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.", L443555, L443554,m473
 Of course.," All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?", L443557, L443556,m473
 Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --, Then you admit --, L443559, L443558,m473
" I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?"," Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?", L443561, L443560,m473
" You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?", I don't know., L443563, L443562,m473
" If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.", I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?, L443565, L443564,m473
 Stop right there., Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned., L443667, L443666,m473
 There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.," All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.", L443683, L443682,m473
 What is your proposal?, When were the Sacred Scrolls written?, L443687, L443686,m473
 Twelve hundred years ago., Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history, L443689, L443688,m473
 Of course., Okay.Up to the cave., L443691, L443690,m473
" I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you."," That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof.", L443723, L443722,m473
 Tell him to pull back!, Cease fire! Withdraw!, L443729, L443728,m473
" Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?"," He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.", L443753, L443752,m473
 Then there is another jungle?," Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.", L443766, L443765,m473
 Sure.," Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?", L443768, L443767,m473
" Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?"," Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.", L443786, L443785,m473
 What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.," The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.", L443788, L443787,m473
 We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.," Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.", L443790, L443789,m473
" Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?"," Listen, listen -- I can speak --", L443259, L443258,m473
 Speak! Go on., My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!, L443277, L443276,m473
 I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?," Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!", L443281, L443280,m473
 Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?, Shhhh!, L443434, L443433,m473
 What is this?, A hearing., L443436, L443435,m473
 It's him...Landon., Which one?, L443501, L443500,m473
 You! ... You knew about this?," No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.", L443509, L443508,m473
 Listen-, Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes., L443590, L443589,m473
" Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.", You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?, L443619, L443618,m473
 Are you going to take her with you?, Yes., L443633, L443632,m473
" Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.", Maybe not., L443635, L443634,m473
 You want her that much?," You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.", L443637, L443636,m473
" What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?", She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant., L443655, L443654,m473
 And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.," Taylor, please --", L443680, L443679,m473
 Taylor! Tell him., He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls., L443710, L443709,m473
 Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.," Taylor, you can't.", L443742, L443741,m473
" Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.", Why not?, L443747, L443746,m473
 It's humiliating., Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?, L443749, L443748,m473
 Would you like to come along?, We can't., L443771, L443770,m473
" Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye."," All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!", L443776, L443775,m473
" Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.", God bless you., L443778, L443777,m473
 He's moving his fingers!, Of course. He saw you moving yours., L443287, L443286,m473
 Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?," Yes, Sir.", L443385, L443384,m473
 Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.," I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.", L443487, L443486,m473
 Do you believe him?," Like you, I find it difficult.", L443489, L443488,m473
 But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture., This is his assertion., L443491, L443490,m473
" How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?", He doesn't know., L443496, L443495,m473
" Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.", Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity., L443524, L443523,m473
" Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?"," But there's the doll, sir.", L443705, L443704,m473
 But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?," He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.", L443764, L443763,m473
 But the proof? The doll?, In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry., L443799, L443798,m473
" Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.", Then I'm here till I die?, L451715, L451714,m480
 Till they kill you. Yeah., Then why bother curing me?, L451717, L451716,m480
 The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken., So it's to be torture., L451719, L451718,m480

If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed?", L451749, L451748,m480
 He will come for me., Of course., L451770, L451769,m480

" No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.", You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything., L471175, L471174,m492
" Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work."," No, no, no... I love my husband.", L471177, L471176,m492
" Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home."," Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.", L471179, L471178,m492
" Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do."," I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.", L471181, L471180,m492
 So altruistic., It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?, L471185, L471184,m492
" Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder."," If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?", L471187, L471186,m492
 You shot Roger., That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon., L471377, L471376,m492
" Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong."," Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.", L471379, L471378,m492
" It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?", Why didn't you tell me?, L471383, L471382,m492
 I didn't know who I could trust.," We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.", L471385, L471384,m492
 Where is he?, He's right here in the..., L471387, L471386,m492
 How did you get onto Doom?, Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will., L471391, L471390,m492
 So where is it?," When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.", L471393, L471392,m492
" Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli..."," Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?", L471396, L471395,m492
 Hold on a second.," Eddie, come on.", L471406, L471405,m492
 Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit., That's what you woke me up for?, L470903, L470902,m492
 Now what?, Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile., L470906, L470905,m492
 They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day., What a gasser., L470909, L470908,m492
 Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?, No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since., L470940, L470939,m492
 What's with the dip?," That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.", L470951, L470950,m492
 What the hell is that?, Doom., L471492, L471491,m492
" Valiant, did you see the rabbit?"," He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?", L470794, L470793,m492
" How much do you know about show business, Valiant?"," Only there's no business like it, no business I know.", L470802, L470801,m492
" Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?", One too many safes dropped on his head?, L470804, L470803,m492
" Here's the problem...  ""Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger"".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.", So what do you want me to do?, L470807, L470806,m492
 Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with., I don't work in Toontown., L470809, L470808,m492
 You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there., The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks., L470811, L470810,m492
 A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous., So's the job., L470813, L470812,m492
 I got him on loan from Disney., Aren't you the lucky one..., L470818, L470817,m492
 When will I hear from you?, As soon as is humanly possible., L470820, L470819,m492
" Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black."," Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.", L470888, L470887,m492
" Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee..."," Sure, Valiant, sure...", L470894, L470893,m492
" Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?", Valiant?  What're you doin' here?, L471096, L471095,m492
 I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph., I've already seen your photographs., L471098, L471097,m492
 Maroon?  Whaddaya want?, Have you got the will?, L471321, L471320,m492
 Maybe.  Why?, Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing., L471323, L471322,m492
 Valiant!  You surprised me., That was the idea., L471339, L471338,m492
" You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?"," No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.", L471341, L471340,m492
" Well, everybody needs a hobby."," No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.", L471343, L471342,m492
" You got the will in there, don't ya?"," No, I don't.", L471346, L471345,m492
" You tricked me, damn you!", Take it easy., L471348, L471347,m492
 Pattycake!  Pattycake!, Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it., L470882, L470881,m492
" My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.", Divorce?  Never!, L470897, L470896,m492
 Aah!, Aah!, L471001, L471000,m492
 What the hell are you doin'?," I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.", L471003, L471002,m492
 So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.," Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.", L471005, L471004,m492
" Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?"," Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.", L471007, L471006,m492
" Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.", Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran., L471017, L471016,m492
" If you're so innocent, why'd you run?"," Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.", L471019, L471018,m492
 Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding..., You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs., L471034, L471033,m492
 Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?," Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.", L471038, L471037,m492
 Does this help?," Yeah, that's better.", L471059, L471058,m492
 You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?," Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.", L471061, L471060,m492
" Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?"," My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.", L471063, L471062,m492
" Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.", I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent., L471070, L471069,m492
 The habeus corpus is thickening., Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will., L471075, L471074,m492
 How do you know that?," Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.", L471077, L471076,m492
" Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?"," Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?", L471081, L471080,m492
" Hey, don't I get an encore?"," Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.", L471215, L471214,m492
" But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh."," And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!", L471217, L471216,m492
" Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...", An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison., L471219, L471218,m492
 Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in., Just because you got 'em to laugh?, L471221, L471220,m492
" A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.", I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety., L471223, L471222,m492
" I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!"," Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.", L471225, L471224,m492
" Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?"," A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.", L471255, L471254,m492
" Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me."," But, Eddie, you know what happens when...", L471260, L471259,m492

" Say, who's this guy laughin'?", Me., L471294, L471293,m492
" Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?"," What is this, Twenty Questions?", L471296, L471295,m492
 You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!," Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?", L471300, L471299,m492
" You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.", A Toon?  Noooo., L471302, L471301,m492
" Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother."," Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.", L471304, L471303,m492
" Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.", Safe?, L471306, L471305,m492
 I'll get it., Get away from there., L471309, L471308,m492

" Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.", That's why I'll be there at 8:45., L471326, L471325,m492
" I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.", Forget it., L471328, L471327,m492
" You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think."," How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?", L471330, L471329,m492

" Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.", Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage., L471456, L471455,m492
" That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.", That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag., L471497, L471496,m492
" Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?", Yeah?, L471503, L471502,m492
