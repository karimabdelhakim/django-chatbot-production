 Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?, What?, L8030, L8029,m7
 The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it., I don't want to., L8032, L8031,m7
 Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you., But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that., L8034, L8033,m7
 Rick...I can't., Never say can't.  Just do what I do., L8037, L8036,m7
" Alice, you think you can leave?", What's wrong?, L8095, L8094,m7
 Kincaid and Joey died last night., What?, L8097, L8096,m7
 You alright?, Kristen..., L8156, L8155,m7
 I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?, It was bad., L8197, L8196,m7
 Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?, I can't find him., L8199, L8198,m7
" Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's."," It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.", L8201, L8200,m7
 I can't go back to sleep again., I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen..., L8204, L8203,m7
 We'll figure it out., Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me., L8207, L8206,m7
 Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.," Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.", L8049, L8048,m7
 I'm sure they're around.," Yeah, I'm not so sure.", L8051, L8050,m7
" I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.", You could do worse., L8053, L8052,m7
 My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?, Sounds like a game show host to me., L8055, L8054,m7
" No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up."," Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?", L8057, L8056,m7
 I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control., How'd you learn so much about dreams?, L8059, L8058,m7
 You what?, When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying., L8063, L8062,m7
" Kristen, what happened?"," You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.", L8101, L8100,m7
 You in a hurry?, I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test., L8084, L8083,m7
 I know.  I hardly have any time to study., Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life., L8086, L8085,m7
" Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.", We have matching luggage., L8174, L8173,m7
 You've been up all night?," That obvious, huh?", L8177, L8176,m7
" Then you saw him, too?"," Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...", L8179, L8178,m7
 No...," You're his sister, right?", L8077, L8076,m7
 Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.," Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.", L8079, L8078,m7
 I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.," It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.", L8162, L8161,m7
 I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...," ""In her dream""?", L8166, L8165,m7
" No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!", Kristen's story really got to her., L8190, L8189,m7
 I've been working double shifts.," Extra money, huh?", L8211, L8210,m7
" No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow."," The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.", L8214, L8213,m7
 How long have you been awake?, Three days., L8216, L8215,m7
" Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?", Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him., L8218, L8217,m7
 Not really., Is there something we can do?, L8247, L8246,m7
 You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him., Why can't we just talk to the authorities?, L8251, L8250,m7
" Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.", Then what else can we do?, L8253, L8252,m7
 Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us., Who?, L8255, L8254,m7
" He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him."," Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.", L8274, L8273,m7
 You just feel sorry for me.," Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.", L8276, L8275,m7
 As long as your driving doesn't kill us.," It's okay, we're just about there.", L8278, L8277,m7
 He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.," You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.", L8288, L8287,m7
 Here we are., Something's wrong here.  It feels like..., L8290, L8289,m7
 What the hell was that?," Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.", L8295, L8294,m7
 You look great!, Save it for later.  Come on!, L8324, L8323,m7
" Rick, please."," Alright, I think I see salvation...", L7996, L7995,m7
 I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them., Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep., L8092, L8091,m7
 Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor., It was Freddy., L8185, L8184,m7
 Enough of that crap., I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in..., L8187, L8186,m7
 T-T-Thanks Alice..., Earth to Alice..., L7994, L7993,m7
" Hey, Rick!"," Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.", L8099, L8098,m7
 I don't get it., Let me talk to you., L8120, L8119,m7
 So what's up?  What'd I miss?, She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality., L8122, L8121,m7
 So?," It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down", L8124, L8123,m7
 Nice neighborhood.," Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.", L8126, L8125,m7
" Hey man, we're all sorry...", She knew she was gonna die., L8159, L8158,m7
 Been up with Alice., How she doing?  I ran into her last night., L8226, L8225,m7
" She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.", About Freddy?, L8228, L8227,m7
 Something the matter with the cuisine?," Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.", L8135, L8134,m7
 What's wrong with me?, Your distraught.  It'll help..., L8138, L8137,m7
" I'm sorry honey, but..."," Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!", L8141, L8140,m7
" Honey, we went over this in therapy."," Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...", L8143, L8142,m7
 Something wrong with the stairs?, Avoid-all-contact-day., L7982, L7981,m7
 What?," When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.", L7984, L7983,m7
 What is it?, Oh God!  He killed them!, L8065, L8064,m7
 Now you know who and what Freddy really is., I though Freddy was just an old town story., L8105, L8104,m7
 I'll tell you later., It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream., L8116, L8115,m7
" It's okay, babe.  We're with you.", I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed., L8118, L8117,m7
 Feeling better now?, Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?, L8067, L8066,m7
 I gotta get out of here., You just stay put.  You need rest., L8070, L8069,m7
" You don't get it, he's after me..."," Don't worry, honey", L8072, L8071,m7
" Excuse us, dear."," It's okay, Dan", L8420, L8419,m8
" Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?"," What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.", L8718, L8717,m8
" Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.", And ours.  It's our grandchild., L8722, L8721,m8
" In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --"," What are you talking about?  My ""condition""?...", L8725, L8724,m8
 We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here., You're not taking my baby!, L8729, L8728,m8
 Hey...wake up., Huh?, L8536, L8535,m8
" Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?"," It's lonely in there, in my room.", L8539, L8538,m8
 I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed., How did you know that?, L8542, L8541,m8
" Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?", Been having bad dreams., L8645, L8644,m8
 Is that who you're waiting for?, No..., L8649, L8648,m8
 I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom., She doesn't want me around, L8651, L8650,m8
 No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?," Who said I...wait, what?", L8654, L8653,m8
 Who says I don't like you?," My friend, with the funny hand.", L8657, L8656,m8
 Mommy...?, Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both., L8793, L8792,m8
 Where is he?," He's inside you, where he hides.", L8802, L8801,m8
 What do you mean?, It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me., L8804, L8803,m8
 But how...?, He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people., L8806, L8805,m8
" Hi, beautiful.", Jesus!  Don't do that!, L8396, L8395,m8
 The tickets.," They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!", L8401, L8400,m8
" Okay, babe.  What's the matter?", Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony., L8404, L8403,m8
 About him?," No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.", L8408, L8407,m8
 You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream., Yeah...I guess., L8410, L8409,m8
" You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...", You're right., L8412, L8411,m8
 There you go.  Love you., Me too., L8414, L8413,m8
 I was afraid you weren't coming.," I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  ""The drunk showed up"", that kind of thing...", L8440, L8439,m8
 That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings., No.  A deal's a deal., L8442, L8441,m8
 Dad!, It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip., L8444, L8443,m8
 Where are we going?, To take a picture., L8447, L8446,m8
" Thanks for everything, Dad.", You sure you don't want a ride to work?, L8450, L8449,m8
" I'm so sorry, honey..."," Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.", L8525, L8524,m8
 How was the meeting?, Sobering..., L8574, L8573,m8
 Very funny., Alice..., L8576, L8575,m8
 Since when are you such a smart shopper?, Since my little girl became a mom..., L8578, L8577,m8
 You disappointed in me?," No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.", L8580, L8579,m8
 Alice!, I've got to go., L8780, L8779,m8
 No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home., But Dad --, L8782, L8781,m8
" Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.", Had kind of a long night., L8363, L8362,m8
" Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl."," No, the Dan part was nice...", L8365, L8364,m8
" Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan."," Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.", L8394, L8393,m8
" It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way."," Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.", L8523, L8522,m8
" Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?", There aren't any little boys on your floor., L8546, L8545,m8
 Did everyone call everyone?, They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me., L8552, L8551,m8
 What's that got to do with it?, When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story., L8565, L8564,m8
 It was just an accident.  Like with Dan., No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger., L8614, L8613,m8
" I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?", Why don't you two stick to reality., L8621, L8620,m8
 You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?, I think Krueger's trying to do something to it., L8673, L8672,m8
" Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...", Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands., L8675, L8674,m8
" I really think you need to calm down now, okay?", I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake..., L8677, L8676,m8
" I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.", Krueger is reality., L8696, L8695,m8
 And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!," What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??", L8698, L8697,m8
 All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?," Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.", L8700, L8699,m8
 Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night..., That's the only reason you're alive..., L8705, L8704,m8
 Are you alright?, Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy., L8760, L8759,m8
 You think that's the place she's buried?, If they actually bothered to bury her., L8770, L8769,m8
 What?, Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late., L8776, L8775,m8
 But how are we gonna --, We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!, L8778, L8777,m8
" You do good work, Alice.", So did Dan., L8817, L8816,m8
 He sure loves to stay awake., That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep., L8819, L8818,m8
" Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.", I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway., L8377, L8376,m8
 Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.," Greta, come on.  One burger with me?", L8383, L8382,m8
 My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house., Well we gotta do something!, L8424, L8423,m8
 I've got to write some of this down., That's why it's my fault Dan's dead., L8557, L8556,m8
" Mark, are you okay?", Yeah.  I'm just aces., L8610, L8609,m8
 I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...," I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?", L8612, L8611,m8
 I thought about that., She must've fallen asleep at the table..., L8617, L8616,m8
 Then get out!, Mark!, L8627, L8626,m8
 Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?, Nobody thinks that., L8634, L8633,m8
" Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.", It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party., L8638, L8637,m8
 Tell me some more about this Krueger guy., Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell., L8640, L8639,m8
 Who's Jacob?, My baby!, L8664, L8663,m8
" Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?", I don't know!, L8668, L8667,m8
 Where are you going?, I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger, L8671, L8670,m8
" I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.", Then we'll find another way., L8711, L8710,m8
 They think I'm nuts., That's their problem., L8733, L8732,m8
" No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?"," That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.", L8735, L8734,m8
 They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business., But I've seen her grave., L8738, L8737,m8
 Poor woman..., No shit., L8741, L8740,m8
 I don't understand., She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment., L8743, L8742,m8
" Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?"," Next life.  Oh, what's that?", L8374, L8373,m8
 Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!," Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.", L8381, L8380,m8
" That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.", You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?, L8422, L8421,m8
 He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes., Who?, L8489, L8488,m8
 Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that., I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?, L8495, L8494,m8
 These things are wild...  What do you think?, Makes you look like a nun--, L8367, L8366,m8
" All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...", Yeah..., L8426, L8425,m8
" Have another one, sounds like you need it."," Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?", L8483, L8482,m8
" Stop saying that, it's bullshit.", I want to talk about the baby., L8559, L8558,m8
 Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are., Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy., L8563, L8562,m8
" Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.", All of us.  Right?, L8571, L8570,m8
 Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.," Two hours a day, six days a week.", L8481, L8480,m8
 Vomit?, Faint., L8499, L8498,m8
" Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!", Mark..., L8623, L8622,m8
" I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!", I can't listen to this., L8625, L8624,m8
 It's okay.," Stick around, please?", L8630, L8629,m8
" You, too?", He invited me to his house last night., L8703, L8702,m8
" Great, great. That's fantastic.", It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost., L84021, L84020,m30
 Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star., That's great., L84024, L84023,m30
 See! The big guy likes it.," I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.", L84029, L84028,m30
 Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives., I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone., L84031, L84030,m30
" Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?", Yes!, L84033, L84032,m30
 I know her uncle. Friends of the family., Who is she? Where does she live?, L84035, L84034,m30
 What do you mean? You don't even know me.," Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.", L84038, L84037,m30
 Someone stole my backpack.," Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there.", L84041, L84040,m30
" I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet."," Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.", L84044, L84043,m30
" Didn't kill anything, did I?"," A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.", L84061, L84060,m30
" I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.", There's only one I want., L84064, L84063,m30
" Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry.", Thank you., L84066, L84065,m30
 Welcome to ya. What's your name?, Edward Bloom., L83881, L83880,m30
 Bloom like a flower?, Yes., L83883, L83882,m30
 You were expecting me?, Not yet., L83886, L83885,m30
 What is this place?," The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.", L83893, L83892,m30
 The poet? What ever happened to him?," He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.", L83895, L83894,m30
 Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate., It truly is., L83899, L83898,m30
 I have to leave. Tonight., Why?, L83937, L83936,m30
" This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.", No one's ever left., L83939, L83938,m30
 You won't find a better place!, I don't expect to., L83943, L83942,m30
 Or are you too scared?, I'll go in right now and get that eye., L83729, L83728,m30
 Then do it.," Fine, I will.", L83731, L83730,m30
" Fine, you do it."," Fine, I'm doing it.", L83733, L83732,m30
 You get the eye?, I brought it., L83738, L83737,m30
 Bloom!, Don., L84091, L84090,m30
 What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!, I didn't know she belonged to anybody., L84093, L84092,m30
 Will.," Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.", L83766, L83765,m30
 Can I see him?, Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him., L83774, L83773,m30
" Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.", My father and I have an advantage. We never talk., L84355, L84354,m30
 How long have you known my father?, Thirty years. Maybe more., L84357, L84356,m30
 How would you describe him?, Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?, L84359, L84358,m30
 Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?, A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish., L84361, L84360,m30
 Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?, No., L84363, L84362,m30
 Did you see that woman?, What did she look like?, L83920, L83919,m30
" Well, she... uh...", Was she nekkid?, L83922, L83921,m30
 Yeah.," It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.", L83924, L83923,m30
 How old are you?, Eighteen., L83928, L83927,m30
" I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.", You're pretty good at arithmetic., L83930, L83929,m30
 How are you gonna make it without your shoes?, I suspect it will hurt a lot., L83941, L83940,m30
 Promise me you'll come back., I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to., L83945, L83944,m30
 You must be Edward Bloom., How did you know?, L84283, L84282,m30
 No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.," Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.", L84285, L84284,m30
 So I've heard.," I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.", L84287, L84286,m30
" In so many words, yes."," Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.", L84290, L84289,m30
 Helping people makes me happy., I'm not convinced you should be happy., L84294, L84293,m30
 You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married., I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference., L84298, L84297,m30
" I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.", I see. I thank you for your time., L84300, L84299,m30
" It's okay, just leave it.", I can get it. I can just..., L84303, L84302,m30
" Lord, I'm sorry I...", Please. Go. Just go., L84305, L84304,m30
 I'll..., Go., L84307, L84306,m30
 Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife., I know., L84315, L84314,m30
" And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.", Lucky girl., L84317, L84316,m30
 Really.," You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.", L83958, L83957,m30
 Hi. How are you feeling?, I was dreaming., L83986, L83985,m30
" Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, ""Your Aunt is going to die."" I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.", That's terrible., L83990, L83989,m30
" Because see, my mother was banging the milkman."," No, I understand.", L83994, L83993,m30
 He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box., Stop., L83998, L83997,m30
 Spooning the sherbet., Can I take your picture?, L84002, L84001,m30
 You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary., Please?, L84004, L84003,m30
 That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else., I never knew., L84008, L84007,m30
 Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.," Oh, so this is a tall tale?", L84010, L84009,m30
 I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.," Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.", L84108, L84107,m30
 Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?," Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.", L84110, L84109,m30
 There was one time when I was eleven..., You were talking about your wedding., L84112, L84111,m30
" I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.", I like your stories., L84114, L84113,m30
" Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.", Really?, L83849, L83848,m30
" Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?", I can., L83851, L83850,m30
" You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here."," What's your name, Giant?", L83854, L83853,m30
 Karl.," Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.", L83856, L83855,m30
 You don't like it?, I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?, L83858, L83857,m30
 Okay., Okay., L83860, L83859,m30
 What did she say?, Beats me., L83869, L83868,m30
 You know anyone's who's taken it?," That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.", L83873, L83872,m30
 You're not trying to run away?," Just to be sure, you can take my pack.", L83875, L83874,m30
" You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.", Make him stop., L83659, L83658,m30
" What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?", I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born., L83671, L83670,m30
 Jesus Christ., Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?, L83673, L83672,m30
" Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story."," No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?", L83675, L83674,m30
 The one about the witch., Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares., L83704, L83703,m30
 You --  -- are in for a surprise., Am I?, L83778, L83777,m30
" Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...", Did you do any of that?, L83780, L83779,m30
" No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.", You think I'm up for it?, L83782, L83781,m30
 People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go., Really., L83786, L83785,m30
 Truly. I saw it in The Eye., The Old Lady by the swamp., L83788, L83787,m30
 She was a witch.," No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.", L83790, L83789,m30
 I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens., So how does it happen?, L83792, L83791,m30
 There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office., Okay., L83795, L83794,m30
" And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?", What did he say?, L83797, L83796,m30
 You owe me three-fifty., Really., L83799, L83798,m30
 When did you ever work in an office?, There's a lot you don't know about me., L83802, L83801,m30
" Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here."," You mean, while I'm here.", L83806, L83805,m30
 Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could..., I will., L83809, L83808,m30
 You know where the chemicals are?," I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.", L83811, L83810,m30
 I thought you weren't dying., I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that., L83814, L83813,m30
" Why not religion, Dad?", It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend., L83960, L83959,m30
 Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.," Oh, so you know.", L83962, L83961,m30
 Did I ever tell you about how..., Yes., L84166, L84165,m30
 The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it., I think someone hasn't., L84168, L84167,m30
 But the real story is how I got the car. You see..., Dad?, L84171, L84170,m30
 Son?, Can we talk?, L84173, L84172,m30
" Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?"," Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.", L84177, L84176,m30
 Dad!, What?, L84179, L84178,m30
 I'm trying to make a metaphor here.," Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, ""The thing about icebergs is...""", L84181, L84180,m30
 The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.," What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?", L84183, L84182,m30
 I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.," I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.", L84185, L84184,m30
" You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.", You think I'm fake., L84187, L84186,m30
" Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me."," It would kill you, huh?", L84190, L84189,m30
" What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?"," Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.", L84192, L84191,m30

 Let's get out of here.," Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...", L84383, L84382,m30
 Where are we headed?, You say..., L84397, L84396,m30
 It's unbelievable., Story of my life., L84402, L84401,m30
 You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens., Yes. Exactly., L84408, L84407,m30
 I'm sorry.," Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...", L84071, L84070,m30

 Daffodils?, They're your favorite flower., L84082, L84081,m30
 How did you get so many?, I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me., L84084, L84083,m30
 You don't even know me., I have the rest of my life to find out., L84086, L84085,m30
 How can I convince you to stop?, Go out with me., L84104, L84103,m30
 I was drying out., I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern., L84239, L84238,m30
 Wait! I need those!, There is no softer ground than town., L83903, L83902,m30
 I've been working on this poem for 12 years., Really., L83909, L83908,m30
 This is why you don't show work in progress.," Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?", L83913, L83912,m30
 I can't imagine any place better than here.," You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.", L83915, L83914,m30
 It's me. Norther Winslow., I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas., L84213, L84212,m30
 I don't believe it!," I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.", L84215, L84214,m30
 So what are you up to now?, I'm robbing this place., L84218, L84217,m30
 This is it? The whole vault., 'Fraid so., L84228, L84227,m30
 Oh. Oh., Hello., L84252, L84251,m30

 How did you know my father?," This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.", L84260, L84259,m30
 Were you and my father having an affair?," Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.", L84262, L84261,m30
" Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?", Because he's dying., L84265, L84264,m30
" Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game."," My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.", L84267, L84266,m30
" Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young."," No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.", L84324, L84323,m30
 You didn't become crazy.," Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.", L84326, L84325,m30
 Thank you. I'll bet you need to --, Yes., L83757, L83756,m30
 I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible., We'll have to pick up a copy., L83955, L83954,m30

" Do you like it, being pregnant?", I do., L84350, L84349,m30
 It's bad., It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo., L83696, L83695,m30
 You need to go., Probably tonight., L83698, L83697,m30
 I'm going with you., You don't have to., L83700, L83699,m30
 I talked with your father last night., Did you?, L84146, L84145,m30
 You never told me how your parents met., They met at Auburn., L84148, L84147,m30
 What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that., That's because most of it never happened., L84150, L84149,m30
 Mmm.," Mmm, what?", L84153, L84152,m30
 Do you love your father?, Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy., L84156, L84155,m30
" You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.", But it's not true., L84159, L84158,m30
" Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.", You're not., L84162, L84161,m30

 What happened?, Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett., L84335, L84334,m30
 How did you get here?," We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.", L83748, L83747,m30
 Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport., We rented a car., L83750, L83749,m30
 Is that Dr. Bennett's car?, He's up with your father., L83760, L83759,m30
 How is he?," He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.", L83762, L83761,m30

" What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?", Yes., L83966, L83965,m30
" How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him."," Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.", L83968, L83967,m30
 Would you say you understand Josephine?, Yes. But that's a different..., L83970, L83969,m30
 Josephine and I have a lot in common.," Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.", L83973, L83972,m30
" I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all."," But I understand you, Mom. I always have.", L83976, L83975,m30
" Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important."," Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.", L83979, L83978,m30

 That really happened?, Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication., L84198, L84197,m30
 Is he awake?, He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him., L84243, L84242,m30
 Mom?, Yes?, L84245, L84244,m30
 Did you and Dad have any other property?, I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it., L84247, L84246,m30
 So you never bought any land., Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place., L84249, L84248,m30
" I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.", I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight., L84340, L84339,m30
" Mom, do you want some time with Dad?", Yes. Thank you., L84346, L84345,m30
 Open up! I know you're in there!, Ah! It's my father!, L187951, L187950,m54

 He wanted the pineal gland., Really?, L208856, L208855,m60
" Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later. Mostly Atlanta.

 Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder., You are.  Now., L282403, L282402,m89
 What's all that?, Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared., L282410, L282409,m89
 You did kill those men., Not all of them., L282412, L282411,m89
" When you finish, what then?", I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin., L282414, L282413,m89
 You make it all sound so simple., The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in., L282416, L282415,m89
 You want me to front for you.," The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.", L282418, L282417,m89
 There was a man once.  Just a simple woodcarver.  But he understood.  More than anyone he could see to the heart of it.  It never ends.  Today is the same as the first.  Tomorrow will be the same as today.  So much time.  And all of it wasted.  You love history?, Yes., L282520, L282519,m89
 The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat., It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg., L282523, L282522,m89
 No.  So what now?  We just wait?, Yes., L282526, L282525,m89
 It's some sort of party the town is throwing., They do it each year., L282529, L282528,m89
 Maybe it would do us both good., There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing., L282532, L282531,m89
" Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.", It's beautiful., L282535, L282534,m89
 I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself., Follow me., L282584, L282583,m89
 William Taupin seems to have left his mark., Yes., L282586, L282585,m89
" And you are William Taupin, aren't you?", Yes., L282588, L282587,m89
 You're using your son's name., No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son., L282590, L282589,m89
 Then you must be at least 70 years old., At least., L282593, L282592,m89
 It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives., A factor of age., L282596, L282595,m89
 I hope I never get that old., You won't., L282598, L282597,m89
" I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.", Why are you here?, L282600, L282599,m89
 I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you., I see., L282602, L282601,m89
 I'm not even sure why., Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer., L282604, L282603,m89
 My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity., You are a very perceptive young woman., L282606, L282605,m89
 Who are you?, That would be difficult to explain., L282613, L282612,m89
 I carried that rifle in World War I.  This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria.  The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College.  Class of 1672.  It goes on., That's why Smith called you MacLeod., L282618, L282617,m89
 Yes., He knows about you., L282620, L282619,m89
 He is older than I., What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction., L282622, L282621,m89
 Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work., That's insane., L282624, L282623,m89
 Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance., Of bodies., L282626, L282625,m89
 I didn't kill the watchman., You killed those other two., L282628, L282627,m89
 Not the same., What about that family in '31?, L282630, L282629,m89
 Sometimes innocents become involved.," You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.", L282632, L282631,m89
 There are differences., You kill with your left hand?, L282634, L282633,m89
 I haven't killed _you_., Is that a threat?, L282636, L282635,m89
 Don't.," Come here, Brenna.", L282639, L282638,m89
 What is it like?  Being you?," Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.", L282652, L282651,m89
 But you're known so much. History I'll only read about., It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away., L282654, L282653,m89
 What is it you want?, All of it finished., L282656, L282655,m89
 Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall., Will I see you again?, L282658, L282657,m89
 What's wrong?," I can't stand it.  Oh God, I can't stand it!", L282721, L282720,m89
 What is it?," I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!", L282724, L282723,m89
 Get out., No!, L282726, L282725,m89
 The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?, The inheritance., L282732, L282731,m89
 Life.  It is the gift and the under- standing of life., You have lived forever., L282735, L282734,m89
" It will be horrible.  The future.  I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing.  Nothing but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?", Yes., L282738, L282737,m89
 Forget it., I'm just curious., L282039, L282038,m89
 Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school., Now there's a new topic., L282044, L282043,m89
 Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it., Thanks., L282047, L282046,m89
 A murder.," You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.", L282361, L282360,m89
 I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right., What do you want from me?, L282363, L282362,m89
 I'm calling an attorney., You and I should talk first., L282366, L282365,m89
 What are you going to tell them?  That you're protecting a man who's killed four people?, Four?, L282369, L282368,m89
 All fashionably without heads., Spare me the details., L282371, L282370,m89
" But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin."," What are you getting at, Moran?", L282373, L282372,m89
" You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.", It'll never stick., L282375, L282374,m89
" But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that."," You're an asshole, Moran.", L282377, L282376,m89
 I want Taupin., What makes you so sure he's the one?, L282379, L282378,m89
 Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year., What's all of this got to do with me?, L282381, L282380,m89
 What were you doing in Felton?, Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him., L282383, L282382,m89
 I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.," Never take up poker, Detective.", L282385, L282384,m89
" Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it.", All I need is for you to check the name., L282342, L282341,m89
 You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.," I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.", L282344, L282343,m89
" Corey, you _owe_ me.", It's that important?, L282346, L282345,m89
 Good way to lose your job., Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do., L282351, L282350,m89
 I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.," It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.", L282353, L282352,m89
 Who is it?, Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania., L282356, L282355,m89
 I don't believe him., Why?, L281960, L281959,m89
" Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.", I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?, L281967, L281966,m89
" Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.", You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?, L281971, L281970,m89
 Requiem acer'nam donaei-, What are you doing man?, L281982, L281981,m89
 -Et lux perpetua-, You'll not be bringing the church into this., L281984, L281983,m89
 Be quiet., -Auditorium nostrum-, L281987, L281986,m89
 Stop., -In nomine sanctus esperitu-, L281989, L281988,m89
 Afternoon., Your name is Conor?, L282119, L282118,m89
 Aye., Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist., L282121, L282120,m89
 You're not from these parts., I am from Spain.  And I would like a moment of your time., L282123, L282122,m89
" I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here.", Please go to no trouble., L282125, L282124,m89
" Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?", Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member., L282127, L282126,m89
 Your marks would suggest great injury., I was nearly killed., L282129, L282128,m89
 I did at that.," And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?", L282132, L282131,m89
 Aye.," I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.", L282134, L282133,m89
 I was driven out., And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew., L282136, L282135,m89
 How can you know this?," First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.", L282138, L282137,m89
" Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?", Pheasant., L282140, L282139,m89
 You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic., Why are you here?, L282142, L282141,m89
 I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal., You're a long way from Inverness., L282144, L282143,m89
 In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth., You know me home.  Me name., L282146, L282145,m89
 When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different., You are the same?, L282150, L282149,m89
" Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?", Yes.  Always., L282152, L282151,m89
 Does it change with me in the room?, It is less., L282154, L282153,m89
 You feel you know me., I don't know why., L282156, L282155,m89
 He told me there could be only one.," Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.", L282159, L282158,m89
 I don't understand., You are still so very young., L282161, L282160,m89
 I'm twenty-two., Not even a single lifetime., L282163, L282162,m89
" Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed.", What?, L282165, L282164,m89
 It is as you are., No!, L282169, L282168,m89
 Listen to me.  Hear the words., This is madness!, L282171, L282170,m89
 It is the truth., No!, L282173, L282172,m89
 Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate., This can't be., L282182, L282181,m89
" You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.", This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity., L282184, L282183,m89
 What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?, You will live.  Survive., L282187, L282186,m89
 Then they were right.  I am evil. This is God's punishment., You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod., L282189, L282188,m89
 Why does he want to kill me?, You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?, L282192, L282191,m89
 Aye.," It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.", L282194, L282193,m89
 But we cannot be killed.," There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end.", L282196, L282195,m89
 How can I stop such a man?, Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help., L282198, L282197,m89
 Why?, We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts., L282200, L282199,m89
 Harder.  Concentrate harder., Me arm hurts., L282295, L282294,m89
 Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!, Go to hell., L282298, L282297,m89
 Impotent cow., Muy Bien!, L282301, L282300,m89
 It will take less effort as you learn., It's like to kill me first., L282304, L282303,m89
 You have a gift.  One you must protect., And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?, L282306, L282305,m89
 The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.," If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.", L282308, L282307,m89
" You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders."," Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.", L282311, L282310,m89
 What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.," All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that.", L282313, L282312,m89
" As they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes.  To feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing.", I do not think I like the sound of that., L282315, L282314,m89
 It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be., I feel hardly nothing., L282317, L282316,m89
" You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.", But why be so concerned about me?, L282319, L282318,m89
" This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.", And you?, L282321, L282320,m89
" I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.", I am not ready for this., L282323, L282322,m89
" You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.", Of course., L282325, L282324,m89
" You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.", That is not me., L282327, L282326,m89
" Go ahead, Senor.  I have my friend to keep me company.", I'll be back when I can., L282333, L282332,m89
" I'm your future husband, remember?", I have no future husband., L281922, L281921,m89
 My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands., What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you., L281925, L281924,m89
" You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.", But I did live., L281927, L281926,m89
 Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel., So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us., L281929, L281928,m89
 Some think not., Who?, L281931, L281930,m89
 There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic., That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?, L281933, L281932,m89
" I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you."," You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.", L281935, L281934,m89
" Please not be touching me, Conor."," I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.", L281939, L281938,m89
" Leave me alone, Conor.  Please."," You're not talking sense, Mara!", L281941, L281940,m89
" If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you.", Do what you must., L281943, L281942,m89
 Oh please.  Another one., What would you like?, L282541, L282540,m89
 Something pretty., Like you., L282543, L282542,m89
 That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?, Far away., L282545, L282544,m89
 David., Do you have cause to bothering us?, L282549, L282548,m89
 Who am I deceiving?, Certainly not me., L282485, L282484,m89
 State of grace and all that., Tradition., L282488, L282487,m89
 Not so scared., Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck., L282492, L282491,m89
 No doubt., You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion., L282494, L282493,m89
 You're wrong.," I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.", L282496, L282495,m89
 Romirez understood.  Not you., Romirez is dust., L282498, L282497,m89
 Finish your prayers?, Finish yours?, L282500, L282499,m89
" Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.", So sure?, L282502, L282501,m89
 Complete your inspection?, They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow., L282451, L282450,m89
 I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us., We need more time., L282453, L282452,m89
 Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last., Not likely., L282456, L282455,m89

 What is your position?, Second musketeer., L282460, L282459,m89
 I understand you joined up in Bremen., You seem to understand a great deal., L282462, L282461,m89
" I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me."," Excuse me, ""sir"".  I thought we spoke as equals.", L282464, L282463,m89
 Equals?," If you wish to play games, Major.", L282466, L282465,m89
 Wait.  I think we understand each other., We have no understanding., L282468, L282467,m89
" Help?  I've seen others ""help"". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.", It can be different.  It must be., L282471, L282470,m89
 We must talk., Stay out of it., L282474, L282473,m89
" Don't threaten me, Private."," Who do you think I am?  One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow?  ""Threaten you""?  You and I just living will always be a threat.  Forever.  Look at your life, Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there but threat.  Threats and nothingness. It's what we live for.", L282476, L282475,m89
 Do not turn your back on me.," You are really going to force this, aren't you?", L282478, L282477,m89

 What was that?  Did you hear that?," It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.", L346476, L346475,m118
 It sounded like it came from the courtyard., From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving., L346478, L346477,m118
" Might we watch, too?"," Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...", L346480, L346479,m118
 And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...," Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?", L346482, L346481,m118
 It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...," And, now?", L346484, L346483,m118
 Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy., Or looked so beautiful..., L346486, L346485,m118
" Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly."," Precisely, my darling.  Your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire.", L346488, L346487,m118
 To be strong and free... that is all I desire.," So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion.", L346490, L346489,m118
" What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.", I didn't know... I --, L345903, L345902,m118
 What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.," I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.", L345905, L345904,m118
 You come stealee tleasoo?," Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.", L345907, L345906,m118
" No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?"," Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.", L345909, L345908,m118
 Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay., Cathay?, L345911, L345910,m118
" Country fa' fa' away.  To the East, beyond the lising sun...", East of Mercia?, L345913, L345912,m118
 You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent," You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?", L345915, L345914,m118
 Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.," Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.", L345917, L345916,m118
 Flozen foleva not good., It's terrible., L345919, L345918,m118
 An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?," I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --", L345921, L345920,m118
 You come stealee tleasoo?, Oh no... Don't you understand?, L345923, L345922,m118
" No, wait... please... listen..."," No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!", L345926, L345925,m118
" Friend Ogg.  Excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you."," Honeythorn Gump, is it?  I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.", L346093, L346092,m118
" Well, bygones're bygones, I always say.", Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged., L346095, L346094,m118
" Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night.", Who might these friends be?, L346097, L346096,m118
 Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature.  We dwarves be not fighters," We be honored, friend Ogg.", L346235, L346234,m118
" So, Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump."," Gump, is it?", L345749, L345748,m118
" Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.", I'm in no mood for dancing., L345751, L345750,m118
" Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing?", Faerie ring?, L345753, L345752,m118
 No!  Tis not the time!  I want no part of your frolic.," Dance, Jack!  The night's but begun.", L345758, L345757,m118
 Enough!, And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure., L345762, L345761,m118
 No... I... I need to rest.," You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.", L345764, L345763,m118
 I meant no disrespect.," Didn't you now?  Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven.", L345766, L345765,m118
 And if I cannot?," Why, Jack, then tis your death song I'll be strumming.", L345768, L345767,m118
 It's bluebells!, What!, L345772, L345771,m118
" Damnation!  Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters!  You've bested me, Jack.", A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine., L345775, L345774,m118
" You be our guest, Jack."," I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.", L345778, L345777,m118
" You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much."," Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?", L345780, L345779,m118
" I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.", I fear she's lost., L345782, L345781,m118
" Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.", What does she want from me?, L345791, L345790,m118
 Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.," It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...", L345794, L345793,m118
 Are ye afraid of me wine?  Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk?  Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted?," Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --", L345796, L345795,m118
 Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?, Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --, L345798, L345797,m118
" But... but, why?"," Big question that, lad.  Why what?", L345802, L345801,m118
" Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?", Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer., L345804, L345803,m118
 Don't you know?," If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...", L345806, L345805,m118
" That much magic I can offer ye, a small measure of entertainment at best.  Making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers."," Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?", L345809, L345808,m118
" If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.", Don't you care about what's happened?, L345811, L345810,m118
" Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night", There must be an answer somewhere., L345813, L345812,m118
" True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.", Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?, L345815, L345814,m118
" Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards", How is it this hag knows the truth?, L345817, L345816,m118
" Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.", Will you lead me to her?, L345819, L345818,m118
 Are we here?, Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child., L345823, L345822,m118
 What do I do?," Don't get caught, that's what! She'll suck your bones like honey- comb.", L345825, L345824,m118
 Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle., And if she thinks me a liar?, L345827, L345826,m118
 The princess is dead.," Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.", L345877, L345876,m118
 Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it., Aye.  Black Baron's mischief., L345879, L345878,m118
 If the horn be restored the curse is ended.," Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?", L345881, L345880,m118
" I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!"," Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.", L345883, L345882,m118
" Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?", I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter., L345885, L345884,m118
" There it be, lad.  The Lindfarne Mound.  Kings long forgotten lie there, lost in their final sleep."," Have we turned grave-robber, then?", L345887, L345886,m118
" A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.", And who might that be?, L345889, L345888,m118
" So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?"," Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...", L345892, L345891,m118
" Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.", You do the praying.  I've work ahead., L345895, L345894,m118
" There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.", What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?, L345897, L345896,m118
" There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.", Better we eat him than the other way round., L345938, L345937,m118
 By the grace of God.," No false modesty, lad.  You're a proper champion.  Achilles' armor sits on you like it was forged to fit.", L345943, L345942,m118
 I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.," Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor", L345947, L345946,m118
 Shhhh!, Screwball!  You dolt!  I've a mind to change you into a toad., L345955, L345954,m118
 What is it?, Something's coming., L345965, L345964,m118
" Pregnant, is she?", It would appear so., L345969, L345968,m118
 Damn them!," Careful, lad.", L345975, L345974,m118
" Don't see why I can't ride, too! I'm second in command, damn it!", The colt's still too small., L345996, L345995,m118
 I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?," We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.", L345998, L345997,m118
" Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.", Save your mischief for the Black Baron., L346000, L345999,m118
 Aye!  That too., You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart., L346002, L346001,m118
 I'll drop a cow on the knave!, Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops., L346004, L346003,m118
 Fine-looking army., We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour., L346006, L346005,m118
" How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?"," A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  The Baron must have left a trail.", L346008, L346007,m118
 Track the demon to his lair., Aye.  And hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying., L346010, L346009,m118
 We must follow that bird., Whatever for?, L346016, L346015,m118
" Jenny Greenteeth said:  ""Follow the raven in her flight...""", Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?, L346018, L346017,m118
 I'm sure.  It spoke to me., Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?, L346020, L346019,m118
 Beware.," Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!", L346022, L346021,m118
 How do we follow a raven we can't even see?, Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes., L346035, L346034,m118
 This is ogre's magic., Blackheart?, L346052, L346051,m118
 Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.," Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.", L346054, L346053,m118
 The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.," Jack, don't!", L346056, L346055,m118
 Worse than the battlefield., What know you of fields of war?, L346061, L346060,m118
 There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing., Well... if the knight be already dead, L346064, L346063,m118
 Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance., That would be Devil's Needle.  Last landmark I know in these woods., L346070, L346069,m118
 Good.," Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.", L346074, L346073,m118
 Twould appear other travelers precede us.," Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.", L346076, L346075,m118
 I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.," Jack, Jack, it's dwarves live here. Hard-working chaps.  Hammering in the forge all the live-long day. Make the most wondrous things, they do.", L346078, L346077,m118
 And this?  Some of their handiwork?, Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly., L346080, L346079,m118
 Better to kill than be disturbed.," Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.", L346082, L346081,m118
 Nice piece of work., Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time., L346089, L346088,m118
 My God!  Look!, Something the matter?, L346107, L346106,m118
" Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.", Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet., L346110, L346109,m118
 Certainly understandable.," Very secretive, they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you don't mention it.", L346112, L346111,m118
 I should hope not!," Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.", L346116, L346115,m118
 I pray always to be worthy of it.," Stoutly spoke, lad.  These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling.", L346134, L346133,m118
" Don't let this talk of heroes upset you, Jack.  Sigurd's sword is no great thing.  The Volsung killed Fafnir.  You killed Lindfarne. That's one worm apiece... I'd say you and Sigurd were neck-and-neck."," We're not in a tournament, Gump.  Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...", L346137, L346136,m118
" Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it.  Rest easy, Jack."," God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.", L346139, L346138,m118
 Make haste!  We've a hard day's march ahead.," Be gentle with them, Jack.  They only march to please you.  Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems.", L346230, L346229,m118
 ... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress..., We'll surely be in our graves if we don't., L346243, L346242,m118
 God's blessing.," There's the way, mates.", L346247, L346246,m118
" What make ye of that, Jack?", It bodes evil., L346249, L346248,m118
 Wait!," Willful creature, that one...", L346256, L346255,m118
 Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...," Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.", L346262, L346261,m118
 Is she... dead?," No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.", L346268, L346267,m118
 We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?, We'll find it., L346270, L346269,m118
 Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago., Heading true north.  We continue in that direction., L346272, L346271,m118
 Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.," We'll trust in faith, Gump.", L346274, L346273,m118
" Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely."," Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...", L346285, L346284,m118
 We'll never find the Baron's castle.," Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.", L346287, L346286,m118
" Wait, Jack.", Nay.  This time we strike first!, L346290, L346289,m118
" Hold, Jack!  Don't strike!", Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends., L346295, L346294,m118
 Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --, But seem to have gotten lost on the way., L346305, L346304,m118
 Can we trust him?, No... but what choice have we?, L346324, L346323,m118
 Never felt so cold in all me born days..., The chill is worse this night., L346352, L346351,m118
" Don't like the feel of it, Jack."," It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.", L346357, L346356,m118
 Give in to despair and all is lost.," It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.", L346361, L346360,m118
 There's more than one way to spring a trap.," Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.", L346363, L346362,m118
" That be so, better you pinch yourself now, Jack.", On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true., L346369, L346368,m118
 Tells you something 'bout him what lives there..., We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders., L346373, L346372,m118
 Why not mine the damned walls?, We do both.  Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under..., L346375, L346374,m118
" A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?", Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already., L346400, L346399,m118
 Easily spoken..., Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly., L346402, L346401,m118
 There aren't enough arrows., Never mind.  Just do it!  Retrieve the arrows somehow., L346404, L346403,m118
 Water doesn't burn...," And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.", L346428, L346427,m118
 There isn't much time!," Been telling you that all along, lad.", L346430, L346429,m118
 What magic have we on our side?," Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --", L346432, L346431,m118
" That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.", Will you chance a miss?, L346434, L346433,m118
 One more turn..., That's it!, L346450, L346449,m118
 Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?, Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked., L346452, L346451,m118
" Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.", Fire away!, L346454, L346453,m118
 He'll be atop the portculis ere long.," Best get down close to the moat, lad.", L346463, L346462,m118
 Aye.  We're good as inside., It's what we'll find there worries me., L346465, L346464,m118
" Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.", It doesn't matter., L346520, L346519,m118
 Nonsense!  Course it matters., ... the Princess Lili... I've killed her., L346522, L346521,m118
" She's sore hurt, Jack, tis true, but not dead yet.", The wound is mortal., L346524, L346523,m118
 Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine., Can you save her?, L346526, L346525,m118
" Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.", I don't... understand., L346528, L346527,m118
" The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock..."," In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?", L346531, L346530,m118
" Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key."," Sunlight, you say?", L346533, L346532,m118
" Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!", Mean you to seek him out below?, L346535, L346534,m118
 I'm not afraid of the dark.," I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.", L346537, L346536,m118
" The kitchen be the most important room in a palace, for if the victuals ain't right, little else is likely to be so.", Did you bring me here to sup?, L346540, L346539,m118
" Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.", What weapon?, L346542, L346541,m118
 Sunlight., Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?, L346544, L346543,m118
 Will you explain what's going on?," Patience, lad.", L346550, L346549,m118

 Can't we move any faster?," Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!", L346557, L346556,m118

" Not in the mood, I'm afraid.", Listen to him.  Not in the mood..., L346601, L346600,m118
 On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --, I'm not denying it's a joyous day --, L346603, L346602,m118
 Where's your joy if you cannot sing?, Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!, L346605, L346604,m118
 She lives... isn't that worth singing about?," She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted.  Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...", L346607, L346606,m118
 The quest's at an end and where's the good of it?  A faerie festival over a pile of bones?," Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell", L346612, L346611,m118
 I'll do anything... face any challenge!, Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?, L346614, L346613,m118
 I was with the Princess., Where?, L346616, L346615,m118
 By the pond.  She was teasing me., Go on... go on..., L346618, L346617,m118
 She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did., And did you?, L346620, L346619,m118
 Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over., That's it then... the ring!, L346622, L346621,m118
 You must find the ring... It completes the cycle, I'll try., L346624, L346623,m118
" Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm."," Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.", L345940, L345939,m118
" Well done, lad.  Stout heart."," Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!", L345982, L345981,m118

 Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!, Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night., L346072, L346071,m118

 You promised!, Never., L345651, L345650,m118

" It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport."," Sport, indeed.", L345657, L345656,m118
 The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face., Blackheart.  Aptly named., L345659, L345658,m118
" Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?", Unicorn?, L345661, L345660,m118
 A promise is a sacred oath., All right.  I'll show you something sacred., L345663, L345662,m118
 Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty., Stop complaining., L345665, L345664,m118
 A gentleman would offer water., Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?, L345667, L345666,m118
 I detest serpents., That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now., L345669, L345668,m118
 What shall we do?, Be patient., L345671, L345670,m118
" Oh, dear.", What's the matter?, L345673, L345672,m118
 I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so., I'll go search for it., L345675, L345674,m118
 Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you., I'm not its master., L345677, L345676,m118
 The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.," Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.", L345679, L345678,m118
 How much longer?, Shhh!, L345684, L345683,m118
 I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about., In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet.  True royalty approaches., L345686, L345685,m118

" Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.", Are you honest?, L345692, L345691,m118

 He'll not flee if I show myself?, Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity., L345696, L345695,m118
 I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming., I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial., L345698, L345697,m118
 Where are you going?, To fetch your napkin., L345700, L345699,m118

 They tricked you., My own father..., L345710, L345709,m118
 How bad was the unicorn's wound?, It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away., L345712, L345711,m118
 He did run?," Oh, yes, and the mare with him.", L345714, L345713,m118
 There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood., I don't want it on me., L345717, L345716,m118
 Its powers are strong., I don't want to be reminded of what happened., L345719, L345718,m118
 Not even the birds sing sweet as you.," Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.", L345723, L345722,m118
 Tis the truth., A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me., L345725, L345724,m118
 There's no happier thought under heaven.," If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?", L345727, L345726,m118
 My lady mocks me.," Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.", L345729, L345728,m118
 My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.," Oh, la...", L345731, L345730,m118
 I'm afraid it may storm., Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?, L345734, L345733,m118
 Tis not fit for a princess.," Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?", L345736, L345735,m118
 I have no wife.," Then, perchance you'll me.", L345738, L345737,m118
 If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.," Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?", L345740, L345739,m118
 Lili!  No!, Jack... Forgive me..., L346500, L346499,m118
 What have I done?, Only what's right..., L346502, L346501,m118

 No!  I won't let it happen...," You've freed me, Jack...", L346508, L346507,m118

 What?, Sunlight... It destroys him., L346512, L346511,m118
 Sunlight?, That's why he goes masked during the day..., L346514, L346513,m118

 Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me., I can't have been under much more than a minute., L346635, L346634,m118
 Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you..., Is what you said about the ring but another dream?, L346637, L346636,m118
" Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.", You're teasing still., L346639, L346638,m118
" Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband.  I want none other."," But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.", L346641, L346640,m118
" You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!", Lili... I love you!, L346643, L346642,m118

 Biting you?, Pinching me!, L346649, L346648,m118
 Pinching?  Where?, Everywhere!  Ow!, L346651, L346650,m118

 Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?," Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.", L346655, L346654,m118
 Honored to make your acquaintance.," Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?", L346100, L346099,m118
" We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.", Thought the weather terrible of late., L346102, L346101,m118
 Step lively now!, His feet shall never cross my lips., L346114, L346113,m118

 He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot., That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished., L345849, L345848,m118
 How do I get the horn back?," You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.", L345851, L345850,m118

" ""Let the sin begins"" -- that was a good one."," Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?", L350246, L350245,m121

" Okay, just point me in the right direction next time."," Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.", L350253, L350252,m121

" To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even includingù  ùthe excess of virtue itself.", That's intelligent., L357285, L357284,m124
" We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.", How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?, L357287, L357286,m124
" Oh, good heavens, no!", How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?, L357289, L357288,m124

" Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.", Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?, L357293, L357292,m124

 Who?," A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.", L357312, L357311,m124
 When was all this?," Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.", L357314, L357313,m124
 He amputated his own leg?," Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.", L357316, L357315,m124
" Well, they didn't actually mean that."," Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.", L357318, L357317,m124
" Well, is it?"," Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?", L357320, L357319,m124
 108 and still active?, You're startled?, L357322, L357321,m124
" Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all."," Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, ""He worried himself to death?"" or, ""This thing or that killed him?""", L357324, L357323,m124
 Very often.," And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.", L357326, L357325,m124
" That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course."," Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!", L357328, L357327,m124
 I surprise you? Now that's news.," I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?", L357330, L357329,m124
" Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course."," Then everything is quite all right, isn't it?", L357332, L357331,m124
 One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?, The only one., L357410, L357409,m124
 And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?," The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.", L357412, L357411,m124
 Yes. I'm afraid it does., Shall we have another?, L357597, L357596,m124
" Charming, isn't she?"," Yes, charming.", L357602, L357601,m124
 Your brother seems quite fascinated by her., Why not? She's an attractive young woman., L357604, L357603,m124
 Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people., Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?, L357606, L357605,m124
 Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely., Suppose she should leave it?, L357608, L357607,m124
 Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.," No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?", L357610, L357609,m124
" Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age."," It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?", L357612, L357611,m124
 You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive., I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!, L357619, L357618,m124
 What do you want?, I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-, L357184, L357183,m124
 Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do., I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!, L357187, L357186,m124
" I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.", No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine., L357189, L357188,m124
 Please let me help you.," Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!", L357191, L357190,m124
 You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?," Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!", L357193, L357192,m124
" Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason."," I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.", L357214, L357213,m124
 No porters here!!, No., L357216, L357215,m124
" What exactly do you mean by ""almost any time now""?"," Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.", L357224, L357223,m124
" You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.", The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!, L357402, L357401,m124
" Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.", Yes., L357566, L357565,m124
" You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]", You've very kind Mr. Lovett., L357568, L357567,m124
" I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story."," Oh, I'm so glad.", L357570, L357569,m124
" Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, ""Lovey""ù  Mr. Lovett! ""Mr. Lovett,"" I said, ""you are an ungrateful fool . . . """," Why, no.", L357572, L357571,m124
" ""Ungrateful fool . . . !""  Those were my very words to myself last night. ""Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."""," Now, what would you like to do?", L357574, L357573,m124
" Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.", Splendid!, L357576, L357575,m124
 Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one., I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?, L357578, L357577,m124
" Oh, immediately.", Then it's done., L357580, L357579,m124
" Oh, thank you. Thank you!", Thank you., L357582, L357581,m124
 We were just going to bury him when you came along., Pardon meù, L357156, L357155,m124
" In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.", Are you so certain you are away from it?, L357210, L357209,m124
 As far away as I ever want to be.," Oh, dear.", L357212, L357211,m124
" Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.", How can we get in touch with them?, L357221, L357220,m124
 The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.," Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.", L357406, L357405,m124
" A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!"," Now, my dear boy. You shouldn'tù", L357616, L357615,m124
 It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?, Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?, L357721, L357720,m124
" I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!", I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone., L357723, L357722,m124
" The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!", Father Perrault is dead., L357725, L357724,m124
" He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!"," Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?", L357727, L357726,m124
" Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?", Yes., L357729, L357728,m124
" You're lying, aren't you?"," No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.", L357734, L357733,m124
 Are you taking me?," Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!", L357743, L357742,m124
" No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!", Hey!, L357761, L357760,m124
" Sit here, near me. I am an old man and can do no one any harm.", Are you the High Lama?, L357418, L357417,m124
" I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival."," Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon asù", L357421, L357420,m124
" It's astonishing - and incredible, butù"," What is it, my son?", L357423, L357422,m124
" You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years agoù  ùyou're still alive, Father Perrault!"," Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.", L357425, L357424,m124
" That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.", That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?, L357428, L357427,m124
 Sondra Bizet.," Oh, the girl at the piano?", L357430, L357429,m124
" Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all."," Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?", L357432, L357431,m124
" We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on."," But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.", L357434, L357433,m124
" Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.", I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help., L357621, L357620,m124
" You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.", Mine?, L357623, L357622,m124
" I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.", Do you think this will come in my time?, L357627, L357626,m124
 Bob! I think I hear motors!," Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.", L356900, L356899,m124
 And be sure that none of the natives get in., Yes., L356903, L356902,m124

" Don't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else."," Do try to sleep, Bob.", L356994, L356993,m124
" Oh, stop it!"," The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something.", L357034, L357033,m124
" George, what are you going to do?", I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is., L357048, L357047,m124

 What is it? Has he fainted?, It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?, L357098, L357097,m124
 He's dead., Dead?, L357101, L357100,m124
 What is it?, See that spot?, L357104, L357103,m124
 Yes., That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map., L357106, L357105,m124
 What's it mean?, It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached., L357108, L357107,m124
" Hello, George.  Cigarette?", Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure., L357243, L357242,m124
 We've had plenty of it the last few days.," It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.", L357245, L357244,m124
" Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.", You talk as though you intend on staying., L357247, L357246,m124
" Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?", What are you talking about?, L357249, L357248,m124
 I don't know., You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill., L357251, L357250,m124
 Don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?," What could there be except just another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right now.", L357253, L357252,m124
" Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.", What do you mean if we should get out?, L357255, L357254,m124
" Did I say ""if""?", That's what you said., L357257, L357256,m124
 Well - I meanù," What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.", L357259, L357258,m124
" George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?", Chang's first question was about the pilot., L357261, L357260,m124
 Uh-huh.," There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?", L357263, L357262,m124

" I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn.

 You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility., I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead., L357687, L357686,m124

 Stay away!, Or you'll what? CAN ME?, L405720, L405719,m143

 Sure., That was easy. , L405480, L405479,m143
 I admire you., Why?, L405487, L405486,m143
" Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.", It is?, L405489, L405488,m143

" I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...", What have they got that we ain't got?, L405502, L405501,m143
" Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does."," Me, too.", L405504, L405503,m143
 You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him., I just want to be a superhero., L405507, L405506,m143
 It's me.," Monica, where are you?", L405649, L405648,m143
 At the Frankenstein Center., Are you nuts? Get out of there!, L405651, L405650,m143
 I'm going inside., What are you talking about?, L405653, L405652,m143
" Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.", He's a psycho! He'll kill you!, L405655, L405654,m143
 Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --, And what if you get killed?, L405657, L405656,m143
" Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.", What?, L405660, L405659,m143

" If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.", Yes., L405239, L405238,m143
 So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?, I just know., L405247, L405246,m143
" Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --"," I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?", L405249, L405248,m143
" Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil."," Good or evil, what's the difference?", L405276, L405275,m143
 You're the Sphinx., And you are a fool., L405391, L405390,m143
" But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!", The wise snake coils before he strikes., L405442, L405441,m143
 You drink too much., When are you going to take off that mask?, L405445, L405444,m143
" Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.", My heart died a long time ago., L405450, L405449,m143
 It is not dead. It is hiding.," Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now!  The great ones RIDE ALONE!  Adios, muchachos! ", L405452, L405451,m143
" Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny..."," And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible...

" We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. ", He is in love. His anger is gone., L405678, L405677,m143
 Oh don't start that again --, LOOK!, L405050, L405049,m143
" Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours."," We had an off night, that's all.", L405067, L405066,m143
 What are you talking about?, What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?, L405210, L405209,m143
 And it would be the right thing to do.," Yeah yeah -- and that, too.", L405214, L405213,m143
 I'm liking this., I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!, L405218, L405217,m143
 Have you ever seen him?, How could I see him if he's invisible?, L405224, L405223,m143
 You sure that's how you spell it?, Yeah., L405233, L405232,m143
 There's just not enough of us.," But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...", L405260, L405259,m143
 There's a big difference., I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure., L405278, L405277,m143
 You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!, But there's still only six of us., L405320, L405319,m143
 So what else has Superman got?, He's got the fact that he's Superman!, L405396, L405395,m143
 This place is built like a fortress., Because that's what it is., L405544, L405543,m143

" He doesn't miss a trick, does he?", What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!, L405048, L405047,m143
 He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!, There's a vague similarity., L405052, L405051,m143
" We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!", But look at him... and look at us., L405058, L405057,m143

 Nah.," Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?", L405091, L405090,m143
 What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you., So you're chicken?, L405093, L405092,m143
 Maybe you should try a more romantic approach., Like what? Cutting off my own ear?, L405102, L405101,m143
 Or flowers., See ya tomorrow., L405104, L405103,m143
 I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!, But we don't know for sure it's the same guy., L405162, L405161,m143
 Let's go., Wait!... Look!, L405170, L405169,m143
 The who?, The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork., L405175, L405174,m143

 Maybe she's right., Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!, L405208, L405207,m143
 Agents?," Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!", L405212, L405211,m143
" But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal."," Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!", L405216, L405215,m143
 Sounds good.," No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.", L405230, L405229,m143
 Maybe there was traffic., Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!, L405274, L405273,m143
" Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you.", Oh shut up., L405280, L405279,m143

 Wow.," And these are my associates, the Shoveler.", L405080, L405079,m143
 Really?," Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.", L405084, L405083,m143
 So what can I get you?, Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw., L405086, L405085,m143

 It's on the television.," Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.", L405121, L405120,m143
" Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!", Mother... it's not what you think!, L405630, L405629,m143
 And why are you wearing that silly costume?, Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!, L405632, L405631,m143

 Hi., And Mister Furious... His anger is his power., L405082, L405081,m143
 She likes you., Definitely., L405088, L405087,m143

 Or Batman --, Or both., L405180, L405179,m143
 Don't crunch the leaves., Sorry., L405188, L405187,m143

 What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?," Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?", L439547, L439546,m158

 And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot., To remember., L439550, L439549,m158

 Was it Pascow?," Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--", L439932, L439931,m158
 Hey--they actually found the place!," Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.", L439471, L439470,m158
 You need a glass?, Not at all., L439488, L439487,m158
" God, that's fine."," Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.", L439491, L439490,m158
 What were you listening to?, Allman Brothers., L439493, L439492,m158
 What?," The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis.", L439495, L439494,m158
 Nice.," I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes.  One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one.", L439499, L439498,m158
 The one that goes into the woods--sure., That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there., L439501, L439500,m158
 You folks ready to go on?, Sure., L439510, L439509,m158
 Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?, Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands., L439514, L439513,m158
 Not yet...how much further is it?," Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.", L439516, L439515,m158
 I can hardly read these.," Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!", L439536, L439535,m158
" No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?"," I think it is so, Ellie.", L439545, L439544,m158
 My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed., Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy., L439553, L439552,m158
 Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?," For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?", L439629, L439628,m158
" Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's."," Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.", L439631, L439630,m158
 It's Church., I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered., L439633, L439632,m158
" Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?", Yes., L439636, L439635,m158
 Bagged cat. What a mess., You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?, L439638, L439637,m158
 Going to tell Ellie?, I don't know., L439640, L439639,m158
 No need to apologize., Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know?, L439644, L439643,m158
" Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back."," It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.", L439646, L439645,m158
 But--, Does she love the cat?, L439648, L439647,m158
" Yes, but--", Then come on., L439650, L439649,m158
" What say, Louis?", Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?, L439653, L439652,m158
 What do you mean?, The place we're going is on the other side of that., L439656, L439655,m158
 We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!," No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.", L439658, L439657,m158
 I'm not climbing that., Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself., L439660, L439659,m158
" No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?"," Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?", L439667, L439666,m158
 Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp., Is there quicksand?, L439671, L439670,m158
" There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.", You're telling me., L439675, L439674,m158
" It's funny, all right."," Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.", L439677, L439676,m158
" Almost there, Louis.", You keep saying that., L439679, L439678,m158
" This was their burying ground, Louis.", Whose burying ground?, L439682, L439681,m158
 The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.," Why? For God's sake, why?", L439684, L439683,m158
" I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?", I guess so...but..., L439686, L439685,m158
 You want to rest a bit before you start?," No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.", L439688, L439687,m158
 What are those for?, Your cairn., L439693, L439692,m158
 Doesn't look like they last long., Don't worry about that., L439695, L439694,m158
" Jud, why am I doing all this?", Because it's right., L439697, L439696,m158
 But--," No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.", L439704, L439703,m158
" I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception."," What did we do, Jud?", L439721, L439720,m158
 I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But..., Wouldn't wash?, L439724, L439723,m158
" No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?", Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself., L439726, L439725,m158
 Can I have another one?, I guess it wouldn't hurt., L439728, L439727,m158
 They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground., Wendigo?, L439731, L439730,m158
 You and this old Indian rag-man--," Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.", L439735, L439734,m158
" Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?", Yes., L439738, L439737,m158
" Why, then, things should be fine."," A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.", L439740, L439739,m158
" A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.", What?, L439743, L439742,m158
 Rachel not feeling well?, Well...a touch of the flu..., L439770, L439769,m158
" Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.", This babe has said enough., L439774, L439773,m158
" Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on."," My father used to have a saying, Jud-- ""God sees the truth, but waits.""", L439777, L439776,m158
" Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?", It's Ellie's cat., L439779, L439778,m158
" Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?", No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie., L439844, L439843,m158
" Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just--"," You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.", L439858, L439857,m158
 --but I think the thought has crossed your mind., Shit! Look at this mess!, L439862, L439861,m158
 I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on., Because something called a wendigo soured the ground., L439865, L439864,m158
" I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?", Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better., L439869, L439868,m158
" I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--"," The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.", L439620, L439619,m158
" Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died"," The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.", L439622, L439621,m158
 Leave me alone!, Remember., L439624, L439623,m158
 The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed., You don't understand--, L439747, L439746,m158
" I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.", Timmy Baterman. That was wrong., L439913, L439912,m158
 Let her go. It's cool.," Louis, the house is beautiful.", L439440, L439439,m158
 And Buckaroo Banzai., Come on--let's parole 'em., L439443, L439442,m158
 Gage's gone!," Jesus, the road!", L439454, L439453,m158
 Thank you. Thank you so much., Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed., L439458, L439457,m158
 The movers--," Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?", L439476, L439475,m158
" You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?"," Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---", L439481, L439480,m158
 ---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---, Did you see his shirt?, L439483, L439482,m158
 My God!, It's beautiful!, L439508, L439507,m158
 I think it's rather extraordinary.," Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.", L439524, L439523,m158
 She's finally asleep.," She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.", L439562, L439561,m158
" It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it."," Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?", L439564, L439563,m158
 Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.," According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.", L439576, L439575,m158
 That's enough of that kind of talk!, I just said--, L439578, L439577,m158
" You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.", And Church will be fine., L439581, L439580,m158
" Well, honey...you know that..."," Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.", L439583, L439582,m158
" Thank you, Louis."," Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.", L439586, L439585,m158
 Getting there., I got eggs down here!, L439626, L439625,m158
 I heard you tonight., I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--, L439810, L439809,m158
 I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard., That's forgotten., L439815, L439814,m158
" Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know."," Yes, I guess I do.", L439817, L439816,m158
 I'm going to try to do better., You're doing fine., L439819, L439818,m158
" You better get going, hon."," Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--", L439887, L439886,m158
" I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy."," Louis, are you sure?", L439889, L439888,m158

" What's in your head, boy?", She.  Goes.  Free., L442192, L442191,m159
 You've got one shot -- and we can't die., You can't.  I can., L442194, L442193,m159
 Enough of that!  Name your terms., Elizabeth goes free!, L442202, L442201,m159
 We got that part.  Anything else?, And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you., L442204, L442203,m159
 You must swear by the Holy Bible.," Eh?  You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.", L442208, L442207,m159
 No!  You gave your word!," Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where.", L442214, L442213,m159
" Hah.  Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot.", He didn't waste it., L442403, L442402,m159
" I know whose blood you need, to end the curse."," Say the name, or I slit your throat.", L442136, L442135,m159
 Allow me the humor of listening to your terms., Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything., L442141, L442140,m159
" The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?", You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need., L442143, L442142,m159
" That's your offer?  You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?", That's right., L442145, L442144,m159
" You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse.  Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.", I'll torture it out of you., L442149, L442148,m159
 Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison., Wait as long as you like., L442152, L442151,m159

" Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that."," See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.", L442158, L442157,m159
 What -- you don't have the medallion?," That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.", L442162, L442161,m159
 I'll watch my back.," Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course.", L442164, L442163,m159
" It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime.  No good can come of it."," Now, Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.", L442216, L442215,m159
" You'd best take a swim, Jack."," The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.", L442219, L442218,m159
" So how did you get off that island, anyway?", You can go to your grave not knowing., L442225, L442224,m159
" No, I really think I do.", All right then., L442355, L442354,m159
 Why don't I want to do this?," Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.", L442357, L442356,m159
" You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.", What're you suggesting?, L442363, L442362,m159

 There's ... another exit?," Aye, for us there is.", L442375, L442374,m159

" So what now, Jack Sparrow?  Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?", Or you could surrender., L442400, L442399,m159
 Now?," Now.  No, don't kill him.", L442139, L442138,m159
 Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.," And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!", L442200, L442199,m159

" Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time."," Commodore, you can't do that!", L442287, L442286,m159
 You're speaking up for him again?, He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig., L442289, L442288,m159
 No.  The pirates have taken Will --, Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy., L442293, L442292,m159
" Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.", I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?, L442298, L442297,m159
" Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.", What?, L442303, L442302,m159
 You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard., Then I can wear men's clothing., L442307, L442306,m159
 That would hardly be proper.," Well, I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin, or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!", L442309, L442308,m159
" Actually, I find it all fascinating."," And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?", L441601, L441600,m159
 Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?, Yes -- yes., L441625, L441624,m159
 It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?, Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?, L441629, L441628,m159
 Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today., Ceremony?, L441631, L441630,m159
 I knew it.," Or, rather, Commodore Norrington ... a fine gentleman, don't you think?  He fancies you, you know.", L441634, L441633,m159
 Difficult ... to say., I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London., L441637, L441636,m159
" Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --", About the day we met. Do you remember?, L441650, L441649,m159
 What?," Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!", L441816, L441815,m159
 I know the code.," If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.", L441818, L441817,m159
" You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.", Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request., L441959, L441958,m159
" I could never forget it, Miss Swann."," Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?", L441652, L441651,m159
 I'm glad we got here in time., Truthfully -- you were a bit late., L442123, L442122,m159
 Why would my father send this to me?," To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.", L442168, L442167,m159
 If I had known --, -- then we never would have met., L442170, L442169,m159
 I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us., I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart., L442172, L442171,m159
 There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!," Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --", L442411, L442410,m159

 Come on!," No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.", L442126, L442125,m159
 Has it changed since the last time you were here?, The trees are taller., L442235, L442234,m159
 Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!, Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it., L442239, L442238,m159

 But ... you did it before!  Last time --," Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.

" You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord.  We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again.  And we've got rum, praise the Lord.

We've got to do something to help him!, L442248, L442247,m159
" Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about."," Not when you can drink instead, at least.", L442251, L442250,m159
" Drink up me hearties, yo ho ..."," What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.", L442255, L442254,m159
 Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.," I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.", L442257, L442256,m159
" That was before I met one, of course.", Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it., L442260, L442259,m159
" Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...", More to drink!, L442262, L442261,m159
" When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!", You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main., L442269, L442268,m159
" Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again."," Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.", L442272, L442271,m159
 Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk., We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs., L442274, L442273,m159
 To freedom., To the Black Pearl., L442276, L442275,m159
" What are you doing?  You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!"," Yes, the rum is gone.", L442278, L442277,m159
 Why?," One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two --", L442280, L442279,m159
" That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction.  The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it?"," You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?", L442282, L442281,m159
 You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.," Nor did you, I noticed.", L442319, L442318,m159
 He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late., Exactly., L442321, L442320,m159
 These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.," I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.", L442323, L442322,m159
" Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  It's bad luck!"," Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.", L442024, L442023,m159
" Make it last, then.  Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?", First -- have you found me a crew?, L442030, L442029,m159
" Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx."," Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?", L442032, L442031,m159
 Say again?," I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.", L442035, L442034,m159
" Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl."," Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.", L442037, L442036,m159
 A fool's errand., Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs., L442039, L442038,m159
" Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?", That he is., L442044, L442043,m159
" We'd best drop canvas, sir!", She can hold a bit longer., L442057, L442056,m159
 What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?, We're catching up!, L442059, L442058,m159
 How did you get off the island?," Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.", L442078, L442077,m159
" Blast it, I'm already awake!", I know.  That was for the smell., L442027, L442026,m159
 How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?," Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.", L442068, L442067,m159
" I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --", What?  He never told me that., L442071, L442070,m159
" Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.", How did he get off the island?, L442074, L442073,m159
" It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.", We're not going to just surrender!, L442185, L442184,m159
 We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--," Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.", L442188, L442187,m159
 Raise the sails.," The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.", L441949, L441948,m159
 Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?, Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate., L441952, L441951,m159
" All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.", Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?, L442384, L442383,m159
 Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?, I don't think that will be necessary., L442422, L442421,m159
 Dead serious., You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay., L441922, L441921,m159
" Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise."," Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.", L441925, L441924,m159
" Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir."," As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!", L441927, L441926,m159
 This dock is off-limits to civilians.," Sorry, I didn't know.", L441665, L441664,m159
" Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?  You two weren't invited?", No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians., L441667, L441666,m159
" That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous."," Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.", L441675, L441674,m159
 What's your name?, Smith., L441698, L441697,m159
" None?  Very well.  You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating."," I said, no lies.", L441702, L441701,m159
" Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?", Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please., L441733, L441732,m159
" Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship.  You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of."," Ah, but you have heard of me.", L441741, L441740,m159
 But it seems to be enough to condemn him., Indeed., L441746, L441745,m159
 We had time to get to know each other.," We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.", L442291, L442290,m159
" Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?"," By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.", L442296, L442295,m159
" I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow.  The island is riddled with caves.  I will not put my men at a disadvantage."," Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.", L442329, L442328,m159
 You would do that?, They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?, L442331, L442330,m159
 Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of., I knew you'd listen to reason!, L442333, L442332,m159
" That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.", I'll be at the wheel myself., L442335, L442334,m159
 You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?, I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates., L441765, L441764,m159
" Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?", You threatened Miss Swann., L441768, L441767,m159
 Who makes all these?, I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day., L441775, L441774,m159
 You cheated., Pirate., L441779, L441778,m159
 Move away., No., L441781, L441780,m159
 Move!, No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape., L441783, L441782,m159
 Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?, Somewhat., L441882, L441881,m159
 Where does it make berth?, Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is., L441884, L441883,m159
 The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?, Why ask me?, L441886, L441885,m159
 Because you're a pirate., And you want to turn pirate yourself?, L441888, L441887,m159
 Never.  They took Miss Swann.," So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone.  I see no profit in it for me.", L441890, L441889,m159
 I can get you out of here., How?  The key's run off., L441892, L441891,m159
 Agreed., Agreed!, L441898, L441897,m159
 Not without my effects., We need to go!, L441901, L441900,m159
 Why are brothering with that?," My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?", L441903, L441902,m159
 I'd die for her., Good., L441905, L441904,m159
 Come aboard.," I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.", L441909, L441908,m159
 We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?, Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term., L441913, L441912,m159
 It's still against the law.," So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.", L441915, L441914,m159
" This is either crazy, or brilliant.", Remarkable how often those two traits coincide., L441917, L441916,m159
 Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!, Aye!  Avast!, L441919, L441918,m159
" For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study."," I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.", L441987, L441986,m159
 Is that so?, My father.  William Turner?, L441989, L441988,m159
" I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.", 'Bootstrap?', L441992, L441991,m159
" Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.", That's not true., L441994, L441993,m159
" I swear, you look just like him.", It's not true my father was a pirate., L441996, L441995,m159
 Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.," He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--", L441998, L441997,m159
" You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'", My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden., L442000, L441999,m159
 Sure -- because he could always go pirating., My father -- was not -- a pirate!, L442002, L442001,m159
" Put it away, Will.  It's not worth getting beat again."," You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.", L442004, L442003,m159

 Just do it quickly., Don't worry.  I've already got a Quartermaster -- there!, L442012, L442011,m159
" Shut up, before you lose them all!", These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --, L442054, L442053,m159
 Wait -- what about the pistol?," The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting, or surviving, really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.", L442080, L442079,m159
 But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--, Barbossa., L442082, L442081,m159
 What's that?, Depends., L442092, L442091,m159
 On what?," On whether the stories are all true.  If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not --", L442094, L442093,m159

On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate.", L442405, L442404,m159

" And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'", 'We might as well make the best of it.', L551428, L551427,m200

" Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself."," It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.", L550955, L550954,m200
" That's a good one, coming from you."," Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.", L550957, L550956,m200
 He has his uses too., What?  He gonna record you on his label?, L550959, L550958,m200

 How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?, We should talk alone., L551285, L551284,m200
 So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do., Yeah... he figured out what to do all right., L551297, L551296,m200
 You think Tran killed her?, The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there., L551299, L551298,m200

 Naw.  She won't call me.," Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.", L550795, L550794,m200
" I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes."," Hey, Iris, you okay?", L550798, L550797,m200

 And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again., He records himself raping and killing her--, L551019, L551018,m200
 But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--," So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.", L551021, L551020,m200
 So've I.  Too much., But this is a bad one., L551023, L551022,m200
 Top ten.," He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.", L551025, L551024,m200
 That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy., Why me?, L551029, L551028,m200
" Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed."," W'sup, Max?", L551112, L551111,m200
 Faith OK?, Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash., L551115, L551114,m200
 Looks like she was holding out.," Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.", L551117, L551116,m200
 He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.," I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.", L551119, L551118,m200
 Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.," You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!", L551248, L551247,m200
 He's been cooked-off, Is he dead?, L551251, L551250,m200
 Whattya mean?, All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff., L551259, L551258,m200
 What stuff?," Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.", L551261, L551260,m200
 Jesus.," Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.", L551263, L551262,m200

" He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade.", What do you mean?, L551316, L551315,m200
 Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.," This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?", L551318, L551317,m200
 2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her., I intend to., L551321, L551320,m200
" No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.", Only way I could stand your ties., L551392, L551391,m200
 I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice., Where's Faith?, L551394, L551393,m200
 I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran., What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?, L551396, L551395,m200
 You just did., Jesus!, L551398, L551397,m200
" So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.", That's pretty much the way it happened., L551401, L551400,m200
" Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?", That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy., L551403, L551402,m200
 Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?, You bet.  Did you like it?, L551405, L551404,m200
 Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect., I won't say anything., L551408, L551407,m200
" Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times."," And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.", L551411, L551410,m200
" No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway."," You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.", L551413, L551412,m200
 So there never was a death squad., Naawww., L551417, L551416,m200
 Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.," Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that.  Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  You gotta take what you can, while you can.  Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.", L551419, L551418,m200
 How did you hook up with Faith?," This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...", L551421, L551420,m200
" Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny."," Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.", L550671, L550670,m200
 How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?, With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig., L550674, L550673,m200
" Yeah, but how'd it get to you?"," I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?", L550676, L550675,m200
" Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.", Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black., L550678, L550677,m200

 So lay it off to somebody else.," Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it...", L550682, L550681,m200
" Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'."," Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.", L550684, L550683,m200
" Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'."," Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'", L550687, L550686,m200
" I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.", Ha!  That's for fucking sure., L550689, L550688,m200
 Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.," Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.", L551142, L551141,m200

" Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.", Who was just here?, L551149, L551148,m200
" Iris, man.  Pay attention."," Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!", L551151, L551150,m200
" Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.", What clip?  What was it?, L551153, L551152,m200
" I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'", She never gave me a tape., L551155, L551154,m200
" You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?"," You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.", L550917, L550916,m200

" Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?"," I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.", L550883, L550882,m200
 I need my case.  It's still in the back., Get it., L550887, L550886,m200
 That would be no.," I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.", L550890, L550889,m200
 I thought we were friends.," No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.", L550893, L550892,m200
 So am I.  Just trying to get by.," No, you're just trying to get off.", L550895, L550894,m200
 Macey... I've never seen you like this.," Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.", L550897, L550896,m200
" I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really."," Look, I gotta get some sleep.", L550899, L550898,m200
 Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.," Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.", L550902, L550901,m200
" Jesus, Lenny."," Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.", L550904, L550903,m200
 Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?, Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97., L550908, L550907,m200
 Forget her., She still loves me., L550911, L550910,m200
 She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this., She's my destiny., L550913, L550912,m200
 Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride., You'll see., L550915, L550914,m200
" You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.", I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain., L550991, L550990,m200
 What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.," It is my sword and my shield, Macey.", L550993, L550992,m200
 What's that?  Present from Faith?, No idea., L550995, L550994,m200
 What is it?, Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!, L551000, L550999,m200
" My God, Lenny.  What is it?", Black.  Jack., L551005, L551004,m200
 Blackjack?  I don't understand--," Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.", L551007, L551006,m200
 And gives it to you., Wants to share., L551027, L551026,m200
" Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.", I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that., L551031, L551030,m200
" Jesus, Mace.  Back off."," This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.", L551035, L551034,m200
 Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me., So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--, L551039, L551038,m200
 Is this great fabric or what?, You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?, L551072, L551071,m200
 He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot., So that gives you something., L551076, L551075,m200
 Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.," I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong...", L551079, L551078,m200
" No more, Lenny.", Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad., L551081, L551080,m200
" She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.", It's not your fault., L551083, L551082,m200
" See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve."," But that doesn't add, does it.", L551087, L551086,m200
 No it doesn't., Because Iris knew somebody was after her., L551089, L551088,m200
" She said ""If they get me"".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.", So the guy's not a sicko., L551091, L551090,m200
" If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko."," Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?", L551093, L551092,m200
 Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?, That's where it gets a little strange., L551095, L551094,m200
 And what about the guy that was following me?, Now you're really getting paranoid., L551097, L551096,m200
" The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck?", Sure., L551099, L551098,m200
 How's Zander?, OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him., L551101, L551100,m200
" I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.", S'okay.  I know you still love me., L551103, L551102,m200
 Whatup Lenny?," Jesus, Mace!", L551121, L551120,m200
 Where we going?, Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car., L551123, L551122,m200
 What is it?, This tie doesn't go with blue!, L551126, L551125,m200
 Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.," Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!", L551129, L551128,m200
 You better keep a low profile for a while., No shit.  You got someplace in mind?, L551131, L551130,m200
" Lenny, have you lost it completely?"," Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  ""A Love Supreme."" Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.", L551135, L551134,m200
 Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.," She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...", L551157, L551156,m200
" Lenny, give them the tape.", It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case..., L551166, L551165,m200
 Shit!, Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant., L551172, L551171,m200
 Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?, Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do., L551174, L551173,m200
 Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!," It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.", L551176, L551175,m200
 This is bad., The gas tank's going to go any second!, L551178, L551177,m200
 Are you out of your fucking mind?!," Fire's out, isn't it?", L551180, L551179,m200
 I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.," Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.", L551186, L551185,m200
 Those two guys were cops., You sure?, L551191, L551190,m200
 Tell me., I can't tell you.  You've got to see., L551201, L551200,m200
 Uh unh.  I won't do it., Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important., L551203, L551202,m200
" Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?", I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all., L551225, L551224,m200
 We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance., You know what this tape could do if it gets out., L551229, L551228,m200
" I've got a good idea, yeah.", People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see., L551231, L551230,m200
" So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny."," Well, look at the plus side.", L551239, L551238,m200
 There's a plus side?, Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you., L551241, L551240,m200
 It was a tough call., I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops., L551243, L551242,m200
 I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her., Why?, L551245, L551244,m200
 He's totally cut off from the outer world., How long does it last?  Oh., L551254, L551253,m200
" The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow..."," Yeah, right, blow it open.", L551266, L551265,m200
 Who's Strickland?, Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him., L551271, L551270,m200
 Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch., Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way., L551294, L551293,m200
" Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--", I'm not going., L551323, L551322,m200
 Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--," Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.", L551325, L551324,m200
 Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.," It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...", L551333, L551332,m200
 I guess., And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?, L551335, L551334,m200
" I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.", You never told me., L551338, L551337,m200
" But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left."," No, it's not.", L551340, L551339,m200
 Mace... you're a girl.," Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.", L551344, L551343,m200
 Got your ticket?, No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake., L551346, L551345,m200
 You see Tran?, Uh unh., L551348, L551347,m200
 Alright.  We're going up., And do what?  Take on his whole posse?, L551351, L551350,m200
 That's the original.  There are no copies., Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal., L551354, L551353,m200
 Take it to him., A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!, L551359, L551358,m200
 Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?, Then we'll be right where we are now., L551362, L551361,m200
 Are we under arrest?, Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours., L551443, L551442,m200
" Hey, Lenny.  We made it.", Yeah.  We did., L551448, L551447,m200
 Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding., See you downtown., L551450, L551449,m200
 Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a guy?, Just Lenny., L551105, L551104,m200
 Right.  That explains it., Are you going to make me beg?, L551107, L551106,m200
 What is that?, Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good., L551109, L551108,m200
" We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop."," Aw, Mom!", L551195, L551194,m200
" No.  I haven't noticed because I make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?"," Sucks.  Hey, Bobby, turn that up.", L550822, L550821,m200
" Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?"," Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.", L550828, L550827,m200
 But I mean isn't he Faith's new-- , Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him., L550830, L550829,m200
" He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing you to do something."," Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.  It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?", L551033, L551032,m200
" Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.", Take the tape to the cops., L551037, L551036,m200
 Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks., This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys., L551256, L551255,m200
 So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!, Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it., L551274, L551273,m200
" Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!", You really want that on your head?, L551276, L551275,m200
 I hate that picture., Where are they?, L591314, L591313,m210
 Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?, Where are they? Last chance., L591316, L591315,m210
" around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?", I'm looking for my friends., L591320, L591319,m210
 How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?, You sent them. I had no choice., L591326, L591325,m210
 It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it., You're wrong., L591333, L591332,m210
" Was that it? Well, ok."," I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.", L591383, L591382,m210
 What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?, Tell her... we'll get him., L590847, L590846,m210
 We won't., Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar., L590849, L590848,m210
 Check and mate., Dream on., L591157, L591156,m210
 Two down. Two to go.," ""Down?"" Wait, don't tell me.", L591161, L591160,m210
 You think I'm crazy., I'm thinking... that explains a lot., L591164, L591163,m210
" Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out.", What do they do that they had to kill her?, L591166, L591165,m210
 I was hoping you'd find out., Yeah. I sure will., L591168, L591167,m210
" Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King."," We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called ""The Hole.""", L591247, L591246,m210
 The strip joint?, I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT., L591249, L591248,m210
 Where is it? This place?, I think we should get some support?, L591258, L591257,m210
 That was a fucking hollow point!, I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people..., L590993, L590992,m210
 Think maybe knives do?, Keep that thing away from me., L590995, L590994,m210
 Fuck! What do you want?, A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car., L590999, L590998,m210
 You killed her. I saw it.," Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  So you're right, spooky. Happy?", L591004, L591003,m210
 Sssshhh. She's resting., Where the fuck did you come from?, L590944, L590943,m210
 You lied at my trial.," I don't know you, man.", L590947, L590946,m210
 Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl., You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today., L590950, L590949,m210
" One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.", There's no scar. Corvis made it up., L590953, L590952,m210
 Wrong. Answer., Who are you?, L590955, L590954,m210
 What did they give you?," They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head ""yes.""", L590962, L590961,m210
 What did they give you?, A job. Construction. Twelve an hour., L590964, L590963,m210
" We're going to play a little game called ""Who's got the Scar.""", What Scar? What fucking scar?, L591296, L591295,m210
" You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!", Good thing in a situation like this., L591299, L591298,m210
 Fucking Zombie., The scar., L591301, L591300,m210
 I heard you were looking for this., You're the guy killed Dutton., L591057, L591056,m210
 Fuck. Me., What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?, L591062, L591061,m210
 Not my arm! What you fucking want?, I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why., L591066, L591065,m210
 The scar. Which of you has it?, Nobody., L591069, L591068,m210
 Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die., How can you die if you're already dead?, L591072, L591071,m210
 You're him. Corvis., I was talking about you., L591074, L591073,m210
 I was a friend of your sister's., I know her friends., L590924, L590923,m210
" Yeah, no kidding.", Your father gave them to both of you., L590927, L590926,m210
 And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?, Someone else did it., L590929, L590928,m210
" You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.", He didn't kill her., L590931, L590930,m210

 No..., ... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said., L591176, L591175,m210
 Erin. It's not your fault., It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead., L591178, L591177,m210

 [Beat] You bled to death., What?, L583794, L583793,m215
 Do you really believe me?," I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...", L583797, L583796,m215
 [Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?, Yes., L583799, L583798,m215
 Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do., I know., L583801, L583800,m215
 Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you., If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?, L583803, L583802,m215
 I didn't kill Officer Harrison., I know., L583805, L583804,m215
 How? Did they figure it out after I died?, No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them., L583807, L583806,m215
 I don't believe a thing she just said.," Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?", L583859, L583858,m215
 I have no idea., You think Lorenson kills you?, L583861, L583860,m215
" Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.", Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with., L583863, L583862,m215
 Why?, Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled., L583865, L583864,m215
 How long do we have?, I don't know., L583893, L583892,m215
 What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy., I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say., L583897, L583896,m215
 Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days., You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't., L583899, L583898,m215
 I might not be able to.," It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...", L583901, L583900,m215
" Me, too."," Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.", L583999, L583998,m215
 You're sure?," Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.", L584001, L584000,m215
 They're not here., They're not., L584003, L584002,m215
 What? What are you thinking?, There're no cars on this street., L584008, L584007,m215
 I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?," I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.", L584011, L584010,m215
 Then why isn't there anyone around?, [Beat] I don't know., L584013, L584012,m215
 Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?, It's Sunday., L584018, L584017,m215
 They've got lives to be grateful for.," William, you're not making sense.", L584022, L584021,m215
 That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.," No, he didn't.", L584058, L584057,m215
" If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face."," Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?", L584063, L584062,m215
 Where are we going?, To the hospital., L584065, L584064,m215
 What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?, Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through., L584068, L584067,m215
 Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her., Ok. Ssh. Rest., L584071, L584070,m215
 What?," When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?", L584085, L584084,m215
 You gotta stop thinking like that.," Then, where are you going?", L584088, L584087,m215
 I've been ok., Good. How's your mom?, L584149, L584148,m215
" [Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie.", Ok., L584171, L584170,m215
 I think so., You're bleeding pretty bad there., L584183, L584182,m215
 It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?, I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive., L584185, L584184,m215
 How you doin'?, I'm doing fine., L584194, L584193,m215
" Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?"," It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.", L583834, L583833,m215
 How?, He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him., L583836, L583835,m215
 I don't understand.," I still don't either, even after all these years.", L583838, L583837,m215
 Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.," I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.", L583851, L583850,m215
 And if I didn't want to come?, I guess I'd ask you why., L583704, L583703,m215
 Because I don't think I'm crazy., You're not crazy., L583706, L583705,m215
 You were convicted of the crime.," That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.", L583709, L583708,m215
 You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged., No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind., L583711, L583710,m215
" Why, what would you do?", I could try to...make it stop., L583716, L583715,m215
 No. I don't want it to., So it's helping?, L583718, L583717,m215
 You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.," Believe me, I know.", L583720, L583719,m215
 My God you look exactly like him., I never knew my father. Did you?, L583824, L583823,m215
" Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.", Why?, L583826, L583825,m215
" At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.", You thought my father was crazy?, L583828, L583827,m215
 What case?, I was working with a boy named Eugene., L583831, L583830,m215
 How'd he get it?, [Beat] I don't know., L583841, L583840,m215
 But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was..., I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here., L583843, L583842,m215
" Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?", How do you know about Dr. Becker?, L583845, L583844,m215
" So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.", Why would we do that?, L583849, L583848,m215
" It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?"," [Beat] Yeah, it is.", L583854, L583853,m215
 Exactly., Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out., L583856, L583855,m215
 You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition., I'll die either way., L583903, L583902,m215
 What do you mean?, You have no idea what's going on., L583907, L583906,m215
" No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.", Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place., L583909, L583908,m215
 You don't understand.," Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.", L583912, L583911,m215
 I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?, Come on. Tell me what you do know., L583917, L583916,m215
 [Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.," Well, what time is it?", L583919, L583918,m215
 Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?, It doesn't look all that different., L583923, L583922,m215
 The future doesn't look different?, No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from., L583925, L583924,m215
 What about the world?, I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life., L583927, L583926,m215
 [Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?, Maybe., L583931, L583930,m215
 Why don't you help me?, Because I don't have time., L583934, L583933,m215
 Why not?, I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it., L583936, L583935,m215
 And how do you know that?, Because of the future. I know what's going to happen., L583938, L583937,m215
 How do you know about Eugene?, You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me., L583942, L583941,m215
 Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.," I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.", L583945, L583944,m215
" I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?", How...how do you know?, L584092, L584091,m215
 You told me this was how it happened., I did?, L584094, L584093,m215
 Who...who kills me?," You have nothing to fear, William.", L584097, L584096,m215
" You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you."," Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?", L584105, L584104,m215
 Can I get some paper and something to write with., What for?, L584107, L584106,m215
 I'm not gonna let that happen.," You still don't believe me, do you?", L584109, L584108,m215
 I do believe you...," No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...", L584111, L584110,m215
" William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.", Listen to me. That's all I ask., L584114, L584113,m215
" He's having absence [pronounced ""absance""] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.", Who told you this?, L584116, L584115,m215
" I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.", What are you talking about?, L584119, L584118,m215
 You know how to get there?," Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.", L584141, L584140,m215
" That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?"," Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?", L583476, L583475,m215
 I tried to kill my wife., Don't you go to jail for that?, L583480, L583479,m215
" Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy."," Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.", L583484, L583483,m215
 What were you talking about the other day?, I wasn't talking about anything., L583722, L583721,m215
 I know you need one when it's really cold.," [Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.", L583726, L583725,m215
 Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.," [Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.", L583728, L583727,m215

" Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...", No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days., L583732, L583731,m215
 It's gonna be sticky., Why?, L583737, L583736,m215
 'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!, So what am I supposed to do?, L583739, L583738,m215
" Geez, how's that for a fucking ""thank you""?", Is it true?, L583952, L583951,m215
" MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?"," [Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.", L583957, L583956,m215
 Becker does? Are you sure?, I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this., L583959, L583958,m215
 You ever been to jail?, No., L583777, L583776,m215
 It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been., I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it..., L583779, L583778,m215

 Of course you don't know.," Why ""of course""?", L583546, L583545,m215
" Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that."," Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.", L583548, L583547,m215

 Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?, Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far., L583560, L583559,m215
 Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat., I'll manage., L583562, L583561,m215

 What's this?, The best I could do with what was in your fridge., L583571, L583570,m215

 You don't think that's crazy?, Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not., L583591, L583590,m215
 This is a great song., You remember it?, L583595, L583594,m215
" But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?"," May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.", L583597, L583596,m215
" They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.", So you never knew your mother?, L583599, L583598,m215
" I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.", I'm sorry., L583601, L583600,m215
 Yeah. [Beat] How about you?," Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.", L583603, L583602,m215
 How?," She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.", L583605, L583604,m215
 I'm sorry.," Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.", L583607, L583606,m215
 I thought you'd killed Freddy off.," We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?", L646602, L646601,m227

 Which means he's having nightmares again?, He's very excited about it., L646606, L646605,m227
 The nightmares., He's excited about the script.  You should be too.  It stars you., L646608, L646607,m227
 Can I read it?," He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.", L646610, L646609,m227
 You mean that was a..., Sort of a trial balloon., L646612, L646611,m227
" I don't know, Bob.  I'm flattered and all, but I've got a kid, now.", So?, L646614, L646613,m227
 So I don't know about horror., Come on.  Kids love horror., L646616, L646615,m227

" No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?", They wouldn't let me..., L646864, L646863,m227
" I can tell you what the nightmares are about.  They're about this...entity. Whatever you want to call it.  It's old, very old, and it's taken different forms in different times.  The only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for.", What's that?, L646828, L646827,m227
" This is still a script we're talking about, right?", I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress., L646831, L646830,m227
" Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?"," It can be captured, sometimes.", L646833, L646832,m227
 Captured?  How?," By storytellers, of all things.  Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then it's held prisoner for a while.  In the story.", L646835, L646834,m227
 Like the Genie in the bottle.," Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.", L646837, L646836,m227
 You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?," Current version.  For ten years he's been imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street.  But now that the films have stopped-  The genie's out of the bottle, Heather, that's what the nightmares are about. That's what I'm writing.", L646839, L646838,m227
" If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?", That's not what the dreams say he's doing., L646841, L646840,m227
 Then what is he doing?," Well, see, he's gotten used to being Freddy now.  And kinda likes it here in our time and space, too.  So...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.", L646843, L646842,m227
 Isn't there anyone that can stop him?," Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.", L646845, L646844,m227
 Me?  Why me?," Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.", L646847, L646846,m227
" That was Nancy, not me!", But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points..., L646849, L646848,m227
" Dylan.  And...  Chase.  My God, Wes, did you know?"," Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...", L646851, L646850,m227
 The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice., Choice?  What kind of choice?, L646854, L646853,m227
" I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy."," Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?", L646561, L646560,m227
" No, not really.  I...", Do you let your child watch your movies?, L646563, L646562,m227
 Of course he is.  Freddy's dead and gone., And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?, L646567, L646566,m227
 Robert?  I...," Maybe we should ask him, hmmm?  We've got a surprised, Heather.  A great big surprise for you and our audience.", L646569, L646568,m227

 Where's everybody?, I dunno -- I can't figure it out. I've invited them all. Why don't they come?, L164832, L164831,m322

" Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do.

You make them work for you."," Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--", L164278, L164277,m322
 Where did it come from?," Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!", L164293, L164292,m322
" Yes, why shouldn't it?"," Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.", L164295, L164294,m322

 Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?, Never!, L164952, L164951,m322

I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!"," That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?", L164872, L164871,m322
 What -- what's on your mind?," You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?", L164874, L164873,m322

That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it.", I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --, L164878, L164877,m322

" Because of my father, I guess."," Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.", L192067, L192066,m337
 Yes sir!," Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?", L191640, L191639,m337
 I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.," Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!", L191642, L191641,m337
" Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.", Not likely!  Where are the speeders?, L191649, L191648,m337
 We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ..., We'll have to go out on Tauntauns., L191651, L191650,m337
 The temperature is dropping too fast., You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it., L191653, L191652,m337
 The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker., Then I'll see you in Hell., L191655, L191654,m337
" What is thy bidding, My Master?", There is a grave disturbance in The Force., L192091, L192090,m337
 I have felt it., Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction., L192093, L192092,m337
 Our destruction?  Who?, The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing., L192095, L192094,m337
" He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...", You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed., L192097, L192096,m337
" But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.", Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset., L192099, L192098,m337
 Captain Solo.  What's the situation?," There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.", L191594, L191593,m337
" Good, and Commander Skywalker?", He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon., L191596, L191595,m337
" With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.", The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going., L191598, L191597,m337
 That's right., You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you., L191601, L191600,m337
" Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man."," I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.", L191603, L191602,m337
" Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on, Chewie.", Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you., L191710, L191709,m337
" Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?", What is it?, L191633, L191632,m337
" Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.", I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?, L191635, L191634,m337
" I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?", Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon., L191644, L191643,m337
" He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.", I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ..., L191685, L191684,m337
 Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!, The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever., L191857, L191856,m337
" Sir, I was wondering ..."," Sit down, and shut up!", L191896, L191895,m337
 I think we're in trouble.," If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.", L191906, L191905,m337
 What are you so grouchy about?," Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?", L191969, L191968,m337
" You, too, golden rod.", I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior., L191988, L191987,m337
 It sounds like it's trying to get in., I'm going to see what it is., L192106, L192105,m337
" We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ..."," Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...", L192126, L192125,m337
" I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir."," Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.", L192157, L192156,m337
" Yes, Your Highness?", You said you were going to stay. What happened?, L191607, L191606,m337
 That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind., Does Luke know?, L191609, L191608,m337
" He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head."," Han, we need you here.", L191611, L191610,m337
 We?, Yes., L191613, L191612,m337
 Not you?, Me?  I don't know what you mean., L191615, L191614,m337
 You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...," And what are they, pray tell?", L191617, L191616,m337
 You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.," I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.", L191619, L191618,m337
 Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss., I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee., L191622, L191621,m337
" There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.", We are fighting for a cause much ..., L191624, L191623,m337
 Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet., And you think you're the one to apply some heat?, L191626, L191625,m337
" Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han, I don't know how ...", Forget it., L191688, L191687,m337
 Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.," No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.", L191691, L191690,m337
 .... I'm afraid there's not much left., What was it?, L191713, L191712,m337
 Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ...., An Imperial probe droid., L191715, L191714,m337
" Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.", I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from., L191759, L191758,m337
 I don't know what he's talking about., Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet., L191765, L191764,m337
 You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.," Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?", L191769, L191768,m337
" Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder."," Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?", L191771, L191770,m337
 Hey!  Someone's still in here.," Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.", L191851, L191850,m337
 Would it help if I got out and pushed?," Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.", L191869, L191868,m337
 This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade., This baby's got a few surprises left in her., L191873, L191872,m337
" I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?", Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us., L191893, L191892,m337
 That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ...., Or you ran into something ...., L191919, L191918,m337
" Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...", Probably an asteroid field ...., L191921, L191920,m337
 Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need., To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?, L191923, L191922,m337
" Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.", I take it back., L191934, L191933,m337
 That Star Destroyer is slowing down., Good., L191936, L191935,m337
 But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer., I'm against that., L191938, L191937,m337
 We've got to get out of this shower., Now you're making sense., L191940, L191939,m337
" There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.", What is it?, L191946, L191945,m337
" Why, Princess, this is so sudden.", Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry., L191976, L191975,m337
 You don't look angry., How do I look?, L191978, L191977,m337
" Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited."," Well, I hope you don't expect more.", L191982, L191981,m337
" I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.", Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go., L191984, L191983,m337
 That was no earthquake., Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser., L192031, L192030,m337
 They're moving away., They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe., L192034, L192033,m337
" Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.", Would you please stop calling me that?, L192039, L192038,m337
 Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.," Yes, you do.", L192041, L192040,m337
" Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.", That's quite a compliment., L192044, L192043,m337
 Stop that., Why?, L192046, L192045,m337
 What are you afraid of?, Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy., L192049, L192048,m337
 Don't count on it.  I happen to like nice men.," Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.", L192053, L192052,m337
 There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized., You mean a man you can control., L192055, L192054,m337
 I do not!, Try and control this ..., L192057, L192056,m337
 There's something out there!, Where?, L192103, L192102,m337
 Are you crazy!," Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...", L192108, L192107,m337
 Looks like some kind of Mynock., There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now., L192112, L192111,m337
 Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.," Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!", L192121, L192120,m337
" I see it Chewie, hang on.", The entrance is collapsing!, L192124, L192123,m337
" Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.", No lightspeed?, L192161, L192160,m337
" Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.", You're going to attack them?!!!, L192166, L192165,m337
 You could have warned him before you shut him off.," Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?", L192208, L192207,m337
 I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.," Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.", L192210, L192209,m337
 What'd you have in mind for your next move?, The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed., L192212, L192211,m337
" Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?", Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?, L192214, L192213,m337
 That depends.  Where are we?, Here ... near the Anoat system., L192216, L192215,m337
" Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs."," You keep logs?  My, how organized.", L192218, L192217,m337
" Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.", Never heard of that system., L192220, L192219,m337
" Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.", A mining colony., L192222, L192221,m337
" A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.", Can you trust him?, L192224, L192223,m337
" You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them."," Let ╘er go, Chewie.", L192228, L192227,m337
 I don't like this., It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here., L192250, L192249,m337
 What are you staring at?, Who's staring?, L192292, L192291,m337
 You look silly., You look great., L192294, L192293,m337
 Has Threepio turned up yet?, Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out., L192296, L192295,m337
 I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right., Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now., L192298, L192297,m337
 He found him in a junk pile ...," Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.", L192302, L192301,m337
" Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident."," Chewie, do you think you can repair him?", L192304, L192303,m337
 No thanks.," Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...", L192308, L192307,m337
 I was worried about you., I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to., L192378, L192377,m337
" ... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true."," ... just remember that, ╘cause I'll be back ...", L192417, L192416,m337
" Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?", I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings., L191586, L191585,m337
 There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base., I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long., L191588, L191587,m337
" Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.", Thanks to you., L191756, L191755,m337
 Probe?  What probe?, That makes a good story.  But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight., L191761, L191760,m337
 About what?," Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.", L191767, L191766,m337
 I hope you make your peace with Jabba., Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us., L191798, L191797,m337
" Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.", No hard feelings?, L192252, L192251,m337
 Are you kidding?, I always said you were a gentleman., L192254, L192253,m337
" That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?", Repairs ..., L192264, L192263,m337
 That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?, Hyperdrive., L192268, L192267,m337
 How's your mining operation going?, Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?, L192271, L192270,m337
" Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.", I'm sorry too., L192327, L192326,m337
" Get out of here, Lando!", Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you., L192381, L192380,m337
 This ought to be good.," Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.", L192383, L192382,m337
 You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over., He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker., L192387, L192386,m337
 All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?," Don't ask me, but he's on his way.", L192392, L192391,m337
" Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ..."," Yeah, you're a real hero.", L192396, L192395,m337
 What about Leia and the Wookiee?, You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city., L192366, L192365,m337
 That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.," I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.", L192368, L192367,m337
 No., Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here., L192370, L192369,m337
" We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him.", I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo., L192403, L192402,m337
 I'll take what's mine now.," Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.", L192424, L192423,m337
 That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--, I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further., L192426, L192425,m337
" Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?", You may call me Leia., L192260, L192259,m337
" Sorry, am I interrupting anything?", Not really., L192310, L192309,m337
" I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.", Thanks., L192312, L192311,m337
 .... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire., You're part of the mining guild then?, L192319, L192318,m337
 It's a lovely outpost.," Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.", L192322, L192321,m337
 What about Han?, I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter., L192385, L192384,m337
 Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ..., ... we're the bait., L192390, L192389,m337
 What's going on?," I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.", L192434, L192433,m337
" Look, I stand to lose everything by this.", We have no use for your kind., L192437, L192436,m337
 Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.," There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.", L192446, L192445,m337
" Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.", You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life., L192478, L192477,m337
 Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy., What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ..., L192480, L192479,m337
" You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.", Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going., L192489, L192488,m337
 We've got to find Luke., His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked., L192499, L192498,m337
 What'd you say?, I didn't say anything?, L192517, L192516,m337
 I knew that set-up was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it., Luke!, L192521, L192520,m337
 What?, Luke needs help.  We must go back., L192523, L192522,m337
" No argument, just do it.  That's a command!", Wait a minute.  We're not going back there., L192529, L192528,m337
 Someone's falling.," It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.", L192535, L192534,m337
 The deflector shields are gone., Are the coordinates set?, L192543, L192542,m337
 I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've got nothing to worry about., That sounds familiar., L192547, L192546,m337
 Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry., I understand., L191674, L191673,m337
 The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier., Is there any chance of them surviving out there?, L191676, L191675,m337
 Have they analyzed the one that was killed?, Not yet.  They're working on it now., L191695, L191694,m337
" We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.", What is it?, L191702, L191701,m337

Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared., It's circumstantial., L281449, L281448,m388
 For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.," I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.", L281451, L281450,m388
 Detective Bedsoe., Lieutenant., L281419, L281418,m388
 When did you get back?, A few days ago., L281424, L281423,m388
 Where were you last night around nine?, I already told you.  I took a walk., L281428, L281427,m388
 Tell me again.  Where'd you go?, Central Park., L281430, L281429,m388
 Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?, No.  I don't scare easy., L281432, L281431,m388
 Where have you been for the last seven years?, Around., L281434, L281433,m388
 She was a good woman., You didn't bring me here to talk about her., L281438, L281437,m388
 I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?, No., L281441, L281440,m388
 You sure?, He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head., L281443, L281442,m388
" I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.", Is that it?, L281456, L281455,m388
" No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours."," Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.", L281458, L281457,m388
" Good evening, Lieutenant."," No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.", L281784, L281783,m388
 I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it., That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were., L281786, L281785,m388
 Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him., Maybe he was a lousy shot., L281789, L281788,m388
 Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face., Most people are afraid of death., L281791, L281790,m388
 Yes -- I think it is., Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?, L281814, L281813,m388
" You'll have no need for that, Highlander."," Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.", L281287, L281286,m388
 I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?, Aye., L281290, L281289,m388
 You?, No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand., L281292, L281291,m388
" We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.", Who are you?, L281294, L281293,m388
 Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life., I learned my fill from Romeriz., L281296, L281295,m388
 The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it., There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good., L281306, L281305,m388
 The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.," Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change.  Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon.  They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day.", L281308, L281307,m388
" You cannot run from your destiny, Conner."," Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more.", L281311, L281310,m388
 Must you do that?, What?, L281348, L281347,m388
 Sing., It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it., L281350, L281349,m388
 Can't you enjoy it quietly?, Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?, L281352, L281351,m388
" Life.  You've stopped living it.  You look, but you do not see.  You listen but, you do not hear.", I hear you., L281355, L281354,m388
 The river., That's all?, L281358, L281357,m388
" Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.", That is what bothers me., L281361, L281360,m388
 I'm leaving., Leaving what?, L281367, L281366,m388
 England.  There is nothing for me here anymore., And what do you think you will find in another land?, L281369, L281368,m388
 Maybe myself., Then it's worth the journey., L281371, L281370,m388
" Thank you, Thomas.", For what?, L281373, L281372,m388
 For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again., I'm sure they will., L281375, L281374,m388
 As friends -- always as friends.," We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.", L281377, L281376,m388
 That is a thought that doesn't please me., If it came down to it what would you do?, L281379, L281378,m388
" You're looking a wee bit green, Thomas.", The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?, L281499, L281498,m388
 France., How long is the voyage?, L281501, L281500,m388
 Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?, Me?  Of course., L281503, L281502,m388
 What are we doing here?, Living.  Remember?, L281556, L281555,m388
 To ask her to dance., She's the King's cousin., L281561, L281560,m388
 Yes., What worries you?, L281574, L281573,m388
 You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?, I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone., L281577, L281576,m388
 That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?, No.  What am I to do?, L281580, L281579,m388
 Well?, It's done., L281602, L281601,m388
 I'll go first., No -- I will., L281616, L281615,m388
 I stood up first., That doesn't matter., L281618, L281617,m388
 You can go first., No -- after you., L281626, L281625,m388
 It will be a good harvest this year., Can you really tell from doing that?, L281229, L281228,m388
 What do you think?, I think you just like to eat dirt., L281231, L281230,m388
" I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.", She's a treasure she is., L281235, L281234,m388
" Your words are kind and they flatter me -- but I think of her as a sister. Besides, you hardly know me.", I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?, L281238, L281237,m388
 This cannot be.," It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.", L281247, L281246,m388
 Agreed., I would like to say goodbye., L281249, L281248,m388
 How comes it your are not afraid?, Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?, L281176, L281175,m388
 I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing., And what would'st I gain from this bargain?, L281178, L281177,m388
 Your life., How?, L281180, L281179,m388
 We had a bargain.  You promised., I lied., L281188, L281187,m388
 Aye?, Where do you go when your mind drifts?, L281565, L281564,m388
 Different places., The past?, L281567, L281566,m388
 Sometimes., Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there., L281569, L281568,m388
 I cannot stay., Why not?, L281586, L281585,m388
 Leaving?  For how long?, You'll no see me again., L281589, L281588,m388
 Why?, I cannot explain., L281591, L281590,m388
" Do you love me, Conner?", Aye., L281593, L281592,m388
 Then take me with you., Where I'm going you cannot follow., L281595, L281594,m388
 Why are you doing this?," Because, it's for the best.  There are somethings that are better left unexplained.", L281597, L281596,m388
 Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber., Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?, L281272, L281271,m388
 Huge., What are you hoping to find inside?, L281274, L281273,m388
" You guys are from the British museum, right?", No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of.., L281276, L281275,m388
 My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I was at the police station earlier today--, I remember you., L281525, L281524,m388
 I was wondering if I could talk to you?, Are you a cop?, L281527, L281526,m388
 No.  I'm an archaeologist., What do you want?, L281529, L281528,m388
 To talk to you.," I don't think we have anything to talk about, Miss Hillman.", L281531, L281530,m388
 Corpses?, Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland., L281534, L281533,m388
 Yes.  How did you know?, A lucky guess., L281537, L281536,m388
" I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?", He was wearing a bullet proof vest., L281539, L281538,m388
 Bullet proof vests don't bleed., You got me., L281541, L281540,m388
 Why do I feel that you know what's going on?," Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?", L281543, L281542,m388
 If it's good advice., This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this., L281545, L281544,m388
 Where did you get it?," It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.", L281549, L281548,m388
 You're hurt., I'll be fine., L281648, L281647,m388
 What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?, Because it's my name., L281650, L281649,m388
 Then who's Russell Nash?, I don't know anymore., L281652, L281651,m388
" You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.", Jennifer., L281684, L281683,m388
 Why do you stare at me like that?, You remind me of someone I used to know., L281686, L281685,m388
 I don't have any answers for you., Who was that man last night?, L281689, L281688,m388
 I don't know., Then how did he know your name?, L281691, L281690,m388
 Do you always walk around with a sword?, New York is dangerous place., L281693, L281692,m388
 You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe., About what?, L281695, L281694,m388
 It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book., I'm interested in mythology., L281697, L281696,m388
 No., You look like you have., L281700, L281699,m388
 Yes., Meet me Tratino's at nine., L281703, L281702,m388
 Why?, I told you I'm interested in mythology.  We can talk about it more., L281705, L281704,m388
 Good evening., You're twenty minutes late., L281720, L281719,m388
 You didn't answer my question., I know., L281726, L281725,m388
 You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?, Why?, L281728, L281727,m388
 I'm just trying to place you., I've lived all over the world., L281730, L281729,m388
 You're not an easy person to get to know., Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?, L281732, L281731,m388
 How come you wanted to meet tonight?, I wanted to get to know you better., L281734, L281733,m388
 That makes you uncomfortable?, A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession., L281736, L281735,m388
 Is it?, Yes -- it is., L281738, L281737,m388
 Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--, --the Calan.  Do you know who they are?, L281740, L281739,m388
 Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?, No., L281749, L281748,m388
 Why not?, Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours., L281751, L281750,m388
" Let me ask you something else.  At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed.  The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section.  What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.", So?, L281754, L281753,m388
 Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them., If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall., L281756, L281755,m388
 That would mean they'd been trapped in there--, --for three hundred years., L281759, L281758,m388
 How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years., Not unless they're immortal., L281761, L281760,m388
 Would you like to see it?, I've seen it., L281767, L281766,m388
 On the back it has--, --the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage., L281769, L281768,m388
" It came from your great, great, great grandmother, Isabelle Tourez, who lived in Paris and died on the guillotine in 1789 -- alone -- and unmarried.  The ring was given to her by someone who loved her -- but knew that it could never be.", You?, L281772, L281771,m388
 You wanted the truth -- now you have it., And the other one -- he is like you?, L281777, L281776,m388

 Must you fight him?, He will not stop until it is over., L281782, L281781,m388
 He's in there!, Get out., L281800, L281799,m388
" Be careful, Conner.", Conner?, L281802, L281801,m388
 What now?, Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another., L281821, L281820,m388
 Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt., Where is the film crew from the British Museum?, L281279, L281278,m388
 They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark., Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented., L281281, L281280,m388
 We're holding the workers down below., Why?, L281314, L281313,m388
 Someone broke into the cavern last night., What?  How?, L281316, L281315,m388
 He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside., How could they get by him?, L281319, L281318,m388
 We found him this morning., What's that next to him?, L281322, L281321,m388
 Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication., I don't think it is a duplication., L281326, L281325,m388
 It has to be., And this?, L281328, L281327,m388
 You stayed here again last night?, I was working on the cataloging., L281387, L281386,m388
" Jennifer, there is more to life than work."," I know, Paul.", L281389, L281388,m388
 Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?, I like my work., L281391, L281390,m388
 I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come., We'll see., L281393, L281392,m388
" It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?", It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?, L281195, L281194,m388
 Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?, I do not know -- and even if I did..., L281197, L281196,m388
 Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head., It does not come off as easily as the young ones., L281201, L281200,m388
 Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you., This cannot be., L281634, L281633,m388
" I am stronger than you, Highlander.", That's what the Kurgan said., L281636, L281635,m388
 Fine -- I've waited over three centuries.  I can wait a little longer., Why did you wait?, L281640, L281639,m388
" It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.", It will not end tonight., L281642, L281641,m388
 You know it's not safe here for you., I know., L281214, L281213,m388

 You kept it?, Yes., L281333, L281332,m388
 What are you doing?, I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake., L281412, L281411,m388
 Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?, Yes -- when their troubles can harm them., L281414, L281413,m388
 I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?, Fine., L281552, L281551,m388
 What will you do?, There's nothing I can do.  I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon., L281554, L281553,m388

 Read her thoughts., I can't., L305534, L305533,m399
 What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell., I don't know any hell -, L305544, L305543,m399

 Was that Swann's idea?," No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.", L355445, L355444,m424
" Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.", Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?, L355447, L355446,m424
 I want to see Swann face to face., Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?, L355449, L355448,m424

 She has no real grip on reality., Does anybody?, L355281, L355280,m424
 Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together., And what does Jennifer think's real?, L355283, L355282,m424

 For an introduction., Well... nobody., L355186, L355185,m424
 I only wear ties for funerals., You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen., L355189, L355188,m424
 Are they all in the business?, It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation., L355191, L355190,m424
 That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room., Have you been in?, L355193, L355192,m424
 A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive., They'll never find out., L355471, L355470,m424
" Look, Ma, no wires."," You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.", L355473, L355472,m424

 I don't think so.  You need me alive., Why?  So you can fuck my wife?, L355477, L355476,m424
" You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick."," Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.", L355480, L355479,m424

" I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...", Is that all?, L355509, L355508,m424
 I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die., And you're not?, L355511, L355510,m424
" Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations.", And he didn't have them?, L355513, L355512,m424
 He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks., Is that all?, L355515, L355514,m424
" No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...", And you believed him?, L355517, L355516,m424
 Did she know where Nix was buried?, No., L355524, L355523,m424

 Maybe... I... don't..., What about Philip Swann?, L355290, L355289,m424
 Why's that?, He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with., L355293, L355292,m424
 What is?, I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me., L355295, L355294,m424

 Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?, Susan's patient is whom we are talking about., L376268, L376267,m435
 Perhaps you could remind me., I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?, L376273, L376272,m435

 'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night., A voice?, L375552, L375551,m435
 In my sleep., What'd it say?, L375554, L375553,m435
 'Yes'., 'Yes' to the deal?, L375556, L375555,m435

 It's going to be great --, Do you think I need a haircut?, L375629, L375628,m435
" Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now, I owned two stations, I wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time.", That's great!

" Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.", I thought this was practically a done deal --, L376166, L376165,m435

 What are their feelings?," If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.", L376378, L376377,m435
 What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?, I don't care., L376381, L376380,m435
 Whose?, Yours., L376384, L376383,m435
 I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me., I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth., L376386, L376385,m435
" I think it's time you went home, Drew.", Certainly.  Goodnight., L376388, L376387,m435
" Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?", I don't think so.  Do you?, L376433, L376432,m435

" The answer is no, quick enough for you?", Don't you want to hear the details?, L376438, L376437,m435
" I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.", So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?, L376440, L376439,m435
" Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?"," Certainly, Bill.", L376442, L376441,m435
 I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all., But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you?, L376450, L376449,m435
" In English, please.", Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday., L376452, L376451,m435
 I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --, The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all., L376760, L376759,m435
 I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --," No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.", L376784, L376783,m435
 And what do I get?, You get not to go to jail., L376786, L376785,m435
 You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof., Proof?  We've got plenty of proof., L376788, L376787,m435
" Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited.  So what do you think, is it --  -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me?"," Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --", L375608, L375607,m435
 You're overthinking it --, I don't think they're ordinary.  I love keychains., L375755, L375754,m435
" Well, I guess he's found one."," Joe, you do get around.", L375868, L375867,m435

" Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.", Are you?, L376204, L376203,m435
 We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe., 'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?, L376206, L376205,m435
 Yeah.," 'It's up to Joe', huh?", L376208, L376207,m435
" Yeah, that's what he said."," Well, that's very interesting.", L376210, L376209,m435
" I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.", Yeah.  Neat., L376212, L376211,m435

" Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news.  As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.", How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?, L376342, L376341,m435
 He was interested., -- But he was concerned about the timing?, L376344, L376343,m435
 The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe., 'It's up to Joe'?, L376346, L376345,m435
 What have you done?  You've gotten the old man fired!," That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace.", L376463, L376462,m435
 I'm going to put a stop to this!," Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.", L376465, L376464,m435
 But I didn't mean to do it!," The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  Would you like to hear the silver lining?  Check that, gold.  I've been working with John Bontecou all along.  We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.", L376467, L376466,m435
 I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you., Go right ahead.  Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting.  And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company., L376469, L376468,m435
" This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.", He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary., L376750, L376749,m435

 She came to us on the Day of the Dead., El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country., L432245, L432244,m466

 How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?, Maybe I blocked it out., L438674, L438673,m469
 It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?, Why wait?, L438677, L438676,m469

 What do you know about classical music?, Nothing.. Selling is selling., L439032, L439031,m469
 Charlie. About last nights.., Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts., L439034, L439033,m469
 But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.," Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?", L439036, L439035,m469
" Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.", What am I going to do with you?, L439039, L439038,m469

" Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did ""Book of Love ùù Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..."" I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?", You know I never could stand your sarcasm., L439114, L439113,m469
" You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this."," And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?", L439116, L439115,m469
" Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man."," Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.

 What are you talking about? Who's Janet?, I just can't trust you anymore., L439122, L439121,m469

 But what has to be different?," Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.", L439126, L439125,m469
 What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?, I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me., L439128, L439127,m469

" Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..", How'd you know about that?, L439240, L439239,m469
 I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific., Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?, L439242, L439241,m469
 What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group., Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other., L439244, L439243,m469
 I'd forgotten how much music meant to you., That's real big of you., L439246, L439245,m469
 Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.," You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?", L439248, L439247,m469
" Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest."," Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.", L439250, L439249,m469
 Just take a look at it. ," If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?", L439252, L439251,m469
 Does this mean you like me again?, It means I care about you and what happens to you., L439254, L439253,m469
" Forget it, it'll never work."," Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.", L439293, L439292,m469
 What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?, I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you., L439355, L439354,m469
 Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there., You're going to listen to me., L439357, L439356,m469

 What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice., What?, L439365, L439364,m469
" You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, ""Peggy, you're scared."" Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.", You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!, L439367, L439366,m469

" You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.", I wish she hadn't., L439305, L439304,m469

" Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants."," But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur.

 I was impressed with what you said in English class today.," Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.", L438923, L438922,m469
 You don't?," He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author ù fat, violent, drunk...", L438925, L438924,m469
 Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.," A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!", L438927, L438926,m469
 The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today., What're you doing here anyway?, L438929, L438928,m469

 The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy., What are you shooting for?, L438943, L438942,m469
" Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more JellùO for me, Mom.'", Don't you get along with your parents?, L438945, L438944,m469

" Young lady, you're drunk!", Just a little. I've had a tough day., L438620, L438619,m469
 I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded., Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles., L438622, L438621,m469

" That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into."," Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands?

" By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.", Joseph returns from the room where GisΦle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it., L457429, L457428,m484
 The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.," Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.", L457431, L457430,m484
" The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches LΘone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.", Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires]., L457433, L457432,m484
" Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.", Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates., L467019, L467018,m489
" All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.", All right. Stand by., L467022, L467021,m489
 We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.," You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.", L467099, L467098,m489
" We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.", Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time., L467101, L467100,m489
" At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.", We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us., L467109, L467108,m489
 The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.," We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!", L467152, L467151,m489
" I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.", Yoda will always be with you., L466793, L466792,m489
 You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.," You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.", L466796, L466795,m489
 There's still good in him., I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil., L466802, L466801,m489
" I can't do it, Ben.", You cannot escape your destiny., L466804, L466803,m489
 I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.," Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.", L466806, L466805,m489
" To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!", I can't kill my own father., L466809, L466808,m489
 Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope., Yoda spoke of another., L466811, L466810,m489
 The other he spoke of is your twin sister., But I have no sister., L466813, L466812,m489
" Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.", Leia! Leia's my sister., L466815, L466814,m489
" But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her."," She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!", L466818, L466817,m489
 Shhh. You have hibernation sickness., I can't see., L466668, L466667,m489

" Yes, my Master."," Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.", L466770, L466769,m489
 As you wish., Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen., L466772, L466771,m489

 What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?," It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.", L466856, L466855,m489
 I told you to remain on the command ship., A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor., L466911, L466910,m489
" I have felt him, my Master."," Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.", L466913, L466912,m489
" They are clear, my Master.", Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them., L466915, L466914,m489

 Wouldn't miss it., How are we doing?, L466707, L466706,m489
 The same as always.," That bad, huh? Where's Leia?", L466709, L466708,m489

" You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.", Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything., L466720, L466719,m489
 Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?, I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend., L466759, L466758,m489
 Luke.," Hi, Han... Chewie.", L466837, L466836,m489
 You got her warmed?," Yeah, she's comin' up.", L466845, L466844,m489

 Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.," Quietly, there might be more of them out there.", L466879, L466878,m489

 Hey!," Han, don't. It'll be all right.", L466930, L466929,m489

 I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!, That's all any of us can see., L466756, L466755,m489
" Hey, are you awake?"," Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.", L466848, L466847,m489
 Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid., It'll work. It'll work., L466862, L466861,m489
 Shall we try and go around?, It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us., L466877, L466876,m489

 I..., Ahhh..., L466993, L466992,m489
 I'm sorry., Hold me., L466995, L466994,m489
 The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.," Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.", L467015, L467014,m489

" Well, look at you, a general, huh?"," Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.", L466820, L466819,m489
 Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.," All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?", L466840, L466839,m489

" Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?"," I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.", L466938, L466937,m489
 Proper?!, It's against my programming to impersonate a deity., L466940, L466939,m489
 What did he say?," I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.", L466945, L466944,m489

" I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.", Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them., L466612, L466611,m489
" I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.", The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation., L466614, L466613,m489

" That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.", We shall double our efforts., L466618, L466617,m489

 Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator., Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast., L467160, L467159,m489

 He's my father., Your father?, L466978, L466977,m489
" Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have."," You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.", L466981, L466980,m489
 Yes. It's you Leia., I know. Somehow...I've always known., L466983, L466982,m489
 Then you know why I have to face him.," No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.", L466985, L466984,m489
" No, you don't. You've always been strong."," But, why must you confront him?", L466987, L466986,m489

 Come with me., Obi-Wan once thought as you do., L467007, L467006,m489
 You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master., I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me., L467009, L467008,m489
 If that is your destiny.," Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.", L467011, L467010,m489
 Obi-Wan has taught you well.," I will not fight you, father.", L467128, L467127,m489

" You cannot hide forever, Luke.", I will not fight you., L467143, L467142,m489
" Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.", Never-r-r!, L467146, L467145,m489
" Master Yoda, you can't die.", Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force., L466777, L466776,m489
 But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training., No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need., L466779, L466778,m489
" Yoda, I must know.", Your father he is., L466784, L466783,m489

" Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...", Unfortunate that I know the truth?, L466788, L466787,m489
" Well, I'm sorry."," Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.", L466790, L466789,m489
" Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?"," I am See-Threepio, human-cy...", L466647, L466646,m489

 We don't serve formula. Snookums.," You serve martinis, doncha?", L470972, L470971,m492

" Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.", You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold., L470977, L470976,m492
 My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...," C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?", L470983, L470982,m492
" And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.", So where is it then?, L470987, L470986,m492
 My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property., Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?, L470992, L470991,m492
" Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown."," Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?", L470856, L470855,m492
" Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'."," Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?", L470858, L470857,m492

 He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.," Big on the musical comedy, huh?", L470862, L470861,m492
" What's this, Roger?", A tweeting bird?, L470782, L470781,m492
" Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.", I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times., L470786, L470785,m492
 Don't worry about me.  I can take it., I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe., L470788, L470787,m492
" So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!", Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money., L470830, L470829,m492
 This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow., You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket., L470832, L470831,m492

" So what's the scam, Eddie?"," Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.", L471073, L471072,m492
 Maybe they just took it out of his pocket., Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open., L471079, L471078,m492
" Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?"," Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.", L471083, L471082,m492
 What was <u>that</u>?, <u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife., L471198, L471197,m492
 The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?, Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife., L471200, L471199,m492
 I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.," Maroon, right?", L471202, L471201,m492
 Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again., What the hell would they want with a gag factory?, L471204, L471203,m492
 What's that comin' from the bar?, Sounds like singin'., L471207, L471206,m492
 I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you., I'll bet., L471314, L471313,m492
" Are you gonna call him, Eddie?"," What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?", L471316, L471315,m492
 Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.," That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?", L471318, L471317,m492
 He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.," Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?", L470924, L470923,m492
 Men?  They look more like weasles to me.," Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?", L470930, L470929,m492
 Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures., So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?, L470932, L470931,m492
" Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?", Ask her..., L471128, L471127,m492
" Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court."," He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.", L471132, L471131,m492
 They must've taken it off me., They?, L471137, L471136,m492
" Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown."," Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.", L471140, L471139,m492
 You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?, Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there., L471143, L471142,m492
 I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.," You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...", L471145, L471144,m492
" I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried."," Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.", L471253, L471252,m492
" Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector."," Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.", L471258, L471257,m492
" These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.", The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal., L471410, L471409,m492
 No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally., So you're Cloverleaf?, L471424, L471423,m492
" Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?", It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use., L471427, L471426,m492
 Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?, They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?, L471441, L471440,m492
" Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.", What the hell's a freeway?, L471444, L471443,m492
" A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another."," That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.", L471446, L471445,m492
" Holy shit, he's a Toon!", Surprised?, L471482, L471481,m492
 You?," That's right, me.", L471487, L471486,m492
 Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.," Earl... it's me, Valiant.", L471151, L471150,m492
" Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?", Toon cops worked me over., L471153, L471152,m492
" Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo."," What am I, Earl?", L471155, L471154,m492
 You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig., No..., L471157, L471156,m492
 Does it hurt?, Not much.  It's hard to talk., L471159, L471158,m492
 Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?," Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.", L471130, L471129,m492
" Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.", That's because I don't have a doorbell., L471168, L471167,m492
" Oh... well, I... I just had to see you."," Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.", L471170, L471169,m492
" Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?", Toons aren't given imperfections., L471173, L471172,m492
" No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.", You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything., L471175, L471174,m492
" Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work."," No, no, no... I love my husband.", L471177, L471176,m492
" Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home."," Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.", L471179, L471178,m492
" Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do."," I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.", L471181, L471180,m492
 So altruistic., It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?, L471185, L471184,m492
" Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder."," If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?", L471187, L471186,m492
 You shot Roger., That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon., L471377, L471376,m492
" Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong."," Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.", L471379, L471378,m492
" It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?", Why didn't you tell me?, L471383, L471382,m492
 I didn't know who I could trust.," We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.", L471385, L471384,m492
 Where is he?, He's right here in the..., L471387, L471386,m492
 How did you get onto Doom?, Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will., L471391, L471390,m492
 So where is it?," When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.", L471393, L471392,m492
" Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli..."," Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?", L471396, L471395,m492
 Hold on a second.," Eddie, come on.", L471406, L471405,m492
 Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit., That's what you woke me up for?, L470903, L470902,m492
 Now what?, Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile., L470906, L470905,m492
 They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day., What a gasser., L470909, L470908,m492
 Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?, No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since., L470940, L470939,m492
 What's with the dip?," That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.", L470951, L470950,m492
 What the hell is that?, Doom., L471492, L471491,m492
" Valiant, did you see the rabbit?"," He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?", L470794, L470793,m492
" How much do you know about show business, Valiant?"," Only there's no business like it, no business I know.", L470802, L470801,m492
" Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?", One too many safes dropped on his head?, L470804, L470803,m492
" Here's the problem...  ""Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger"".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.", So what do you want me to do?, L470807, L470806,m492
 Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with., I don't work in Toontown., L470809, L470808,m492
 You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there., The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks., L470811, L470810,m492
 A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous., So's the job., L470813, L470812,m492
 I got him on loan from Disney., Aren't you the lucky one..., L470818, L470817,m492
 When will I hear from you?, As soon as is humanly possible., L470820, L470819,m492

" Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee..."," Sure, Valiant, sure...", L470894, L470893,m492
" Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?", Valiant?  What're you doin' here?, L471096, L471095,m492
 I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph., I've already seen your photographs., L471098, L471097,m492
 Maroon?  Whaddaya want?, Have you got the will?, L471321, L471320,m492
 Maybe.  Why?, Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing., L471323, L471322,m492
 Valiant!  You surprised me., That was the idea., L471339, L471338,m492
" You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?"," No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.", L471341, L471340,m492
" Well, everybody needs a hobby."," No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.", L471343, L471342,m492
" You got the will in there, don't ya?"," No, I don't.", L471346, L471345,m492

 What the hell are you doin'?," I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.", L471003, L471002,m492
 So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.," Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.", L471005, L471004,m492
" Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?"," Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.", L471007, L471006,m492
" Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.", Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran., L471017, L471016,m492
" If you're so innocent, why'd you run?"," Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.", L471019, L471018,m492
 Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding..., You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs., L471034, L471033,m492
 Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?," Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.", L471038, L471037,m492
 Does this help?," Yeah, that's better.", L471059, L471058,m492
 You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?," Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.", L471061, L471060,m492
" Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?"," My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.", L471063, L471062,m492
" Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.", I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent., L471070, L471069,m492
 The habeus corpus is thickening., Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will., L471075, L471074,m492
 How do you know that?," Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.", L471077, L471076,m492
" Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?"," Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?", L471081, L471080,m492
" Hey, don't I get an encore?"," Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.", L471215, L471214,m492
" But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh."," And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!", L471217, L471216,m492
" Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...", An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison., L471219, L471218,m492
 Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in., Just because you got 'em to laugh?, L471221, L471220,m492
" A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.", I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety., L471223, L471222,m492

" Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.

 Katrina...," Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?", L511790, L511789,m517
 Where are we going?, I do not know.  Away., L511887, L511886,m517
 The church., He moves too fast., L511904, L511903,m517
 What was that?, His horse., L511906, L511905,m517
 Ichabod..., Keep climbing.  I will follow..., L511913, L511912,m517
" Quickly, close it.", No.  Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump., L511917, L511916,m517
 The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me., I... I can't do this., L511920, L511919,m517
 You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?," It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.", L511330, L511329,m517
 Returning to the Western Woods?," Yes, actually.", L511589, L511588,m517
 Use caution., Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here., L511591, L511590,m517
" Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.", No.  She has gone out., L511733, L511732,m517
 Where?," She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?", L511735, L511734,m517
 It appears well.  It has already clotted., Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?, L511739, L511738,m517
 I know you saw me., What... ?, L511742, L511741,m517
 You cannot kill what is already dead., Let her go!, L511930, L511929,m517
 Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?, I can show exactly., L511347, L511346,m517
" Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible..."," To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?", L511349, L511348,m517
" There was not much blood, was there?", I didn't see none., L511351, L511350,m517
" Van Ripper, turn the coach about!", What did you say?, L511830, L511829,m517
 Van Ripper... do you have a gun?, Yes.  Here..., L511852, L511851,m517
 Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?, You are from the Hollow?, L511500, L511499,m517
 The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him?  The Redman?  I should tell you... he has been murdered., Leave me.  You are not welcome here., L511503, L511502,m517
 I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow and back., The Horseman.  Yes., L511508, L511507,m517
 Can you help?," You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.", L511511, L511510,m517
 What... what are you doing?, Close your mouth!  Keep silent., L511513, L511512,m517
" Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move."," Doctor, he is awake.", L511657, L511656,m517
 You... you are alive.," Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?", L511857, L511856,m517
 He rides tonight., Father saw you die., L511861, L511860,m517
" Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love."," No one will believe your lies, whore.", L511866, L511865,m517
 Go home., May I see my mother?, L511562, L511561,m517
 You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father., She did not do it... please listen..., L511564, L511563,m517
 She is guilty.," No, sir, please... she is innocent...", L511566, L511565,m517
 She has confessed., No., L511568, L511567,m517
" I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?", I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition., L542090, L542089,m529
" Well, we'll see...", You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon., L542162, L542161,m529
 The Empire must have gotten here first., The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it., L542171, L542170,m529
" Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time."," Well, I've brought you here.  What now?", L542173, L542172,m529
 We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them., Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?, L542175, L542174,m529
" No, not anymore.", I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system., L542177, L542176,m529
" Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.", Who's going to pay me then?, L542181, L542180,m529
 I think there are some things we should talk about., I'm beginning not to like you., L542183, L542182,m529
 How much do you think she's talking about?," A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...", L542185, L542184,m529
" Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault."," This isn't a game, you know.", L542198, L542197,m529
" Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.", Fear is their greatest weapon., L542201, L542200,m529
 You have your father's style.  You've done very well., Not bad., L542206, L542205,m529
 We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?, Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn..., L542219, L542218,m529
 We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.," All right then, we'll use your plan.", L542221, L542220,m529
 I'll get the information., ... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments., L542223, L542222,m529
 Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal., Is that good or bad?, L542250, L542249,m529
 Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.," There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?", L542256, L542255,m529
" That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything."," We'll be back before you are, old man.", L542274, L542273,m529
 Good morning!," What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?", L541995, L541994,m529
" Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.", Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!, L541999, L541998,m529
" I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu."," Oh, so you're a warrior then?", L542008, L542007,m529
 Who are you anyway?, You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi., L542014, L542013,m529
 You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?, I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories., L542016, L542015,m529
 I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met., I am the son of Annikin Starkiller., L542019, L542018,m529
 I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important., But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father..., L542021, L542020,m529
 I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper., I know that., L542023, L542022,m529
 You saw through me?, You could put it that way., L542025, L542024,m529
 I assure you my intentions weren't bad.," I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?", L542027, L542026,m529
 I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing., But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it., L542031, L542030,m529
" I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years."," But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!", L542033, L542032,m529
 You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me., My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was..., L542040, L542039,m529
" Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.", You mean I generate an energy field?, L542042, L542041,m529
 It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!, Could I learn to feel it?, L542044, L542043,m529
" That is not a human decision, not your or mine.", What do you mean?, L542046, L542045,m529
" Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.", But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help., L542050, L542049,m529
" A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.", How can you store an energy field within you?, L542052, L542051,m529
" When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.", Don't you have a Kiber crystal?, L542054, L542053,m529
" I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...", That's where my father was killed., L542056, L542055,m529
 Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful., Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?, L542058, L542057,m529
 They use the Bogan Force.," Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.", L542060, L542059,m529
 We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?," Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.", L542094, L542093,m529
 This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?, He's bluffing..., L542117, L542116,m529
" When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?", I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there., L542136, L542135,m529
 But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?, These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the..., L542138, L542137,m529
 What's wrong?  What's happening?," Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.", L542140, L542139,m529
 Are you all right?," Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.", L542142, L542141,m529
 Are you sure you don't need it?, I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on., L542155, L542154,m529
 What do I do?," All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.", L542157, L542156,m529
 What is it?, He can't find Organa Major., L542165, L542164,m529
 But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases., You mean we should go after her!..., L542191, L542190,m529
 I can't see!  How can I fight?, Try to feel it.  Use the Force..., L542212, L542211,m529
 I can't do it.  I'll get hit.," Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.", L542214, L542213,m529
" See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it."," I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.", L542216, L542215,m529
 What about the princess?, You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal., L542253, L542252,m529
 The Kiber Crystal., Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it., L542433, L542432,m529
" Of course, where you been kid?", You look great!  The uniform and everything!, L541905, L541904,m529
" That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!", But there was a lot of firing earlier..., L541910, L541909,m529
" I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...", But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?, L541930, L541929,m529
" The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.", At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position., L541932, L541931,m529
 You're Starkiller?," Yes, sir.", L542448, L542447,m529
 Have you been checked out?," Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.", L542450, L542449,m529
" Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on."," Yes, sir.", L542452, L542451,m529
" Blue Five, does that glare bother you?", I've got it blocked.  I'm all right., L542464, L542463,m529
" I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.", What's that?, L542491, L542490,m529
" Blue Five, break off your cover attack.  It's too late.  Make your own run on the exhaust port.  Do you copy, Luke?"," Yes, sir, but I can get him...", L542493, L542492,m529
 No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.," Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.", L542226, L542225,m529
 Should we alert the Sith Lords?, I'll make a report later., L542228, L542227,m529
" As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.", Send one squad up., L542230, L542229,m529
 We don't get many visitors.  Let's take a look at it., Send out a boarding party.  Full assault gear., L542233, L542232,m529
 Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.," Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!", L542362, L542361,m529
 Here come six more... grid two!, Was this trip really necessary?, L542386, L542385,m529
 There are only three or four left.," Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.", L542389, L542388,m529
 All the data banks in Artoo are still secure., Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through., L542394, L542393,m529
" When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.", What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?, L542396, L542395,m529
" The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo."," We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.", L542398, L542397,m529
 Where are you taking us now anyway?, The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca., L542400, L542399,m529
 I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless., Did it occur to you they might find us?, L542411, L542410,m529
 We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives., I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks., L542413, L542412,m529
" What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it."," I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?", L542421, L542420,m529
 Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand., That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first., L542092, L542091,m529
 You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.," We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.", L542097, L542096,m529
 Who's the pilot?, It's automatic., L542151, L542150,m529
" I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.", You don't believe in the Force?, L542159, L542158,m529
 I found it... It's just not there., What are you saying?, L542167, L542166,m529
 You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them..., Why?, L542179, L542178,m529
 Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.," All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.", L542188, L542187,m529
" No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!", Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try., L542195, L542194,m529
" Well, I practice a lot..."," You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?", L542208, L542207,m529
" Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.", Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around., L542268, L542267,m529
 This isn't going to work., Why didn't you say so before., L542281, L542280,m529
 Something has happened to them. Let's try this way..., Let's try this way!  Holy Maker., L542307, L542306,m529
 I think she's going to be all right., Not if this tunnel deadends., L542314, L542313,m529
 Is he afraid of the water?," No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.", L542320, L542319,m529
 Watch it!  Move back., Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away., L542323, L542322,m529
" It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!", Move out of the way!, L542328, L542327,m529
 Get to the ship!, Come back here... Where are you going?, L542349, L542348,m529
 I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right., They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there., L542407, L542406,m529
 You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...," I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.", L542429, L542428,m529

" No need, everything's under control.", With four casualties?!, L542290, L542289,m529
 The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed., Who is this?  What's your operating..., L542292, L542291,m529

 Who is...'V'ger'...?, V'ger is that which programmed me., L544948, L544947,m531
 Where is Lt. Ilia?, That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise., L544952, L544951,m531
 Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?, V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator., L544955, L544954,m531
 Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?, To join with him., L544957, L544956,m531
 The Creator is that which created V'ger., Who is V'ger?, L544962, L544961,m531
 The examination is a normal function., You may proceede., L544968, L544967,m531
 <U>Why</U>...?!, The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet., L545120, L545119,m531
 <U>Why</U>?!, The Creator has not answered., L545122, L545121,m531
 The carbon-units are not responsible for that., You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner., L545124, L545123,m531
 Disclose the information., Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet., L545137, L545136,m531
" Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?", Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet., L545150, L545149,m531
 They have repressed the Creator., The information will not be disclosed., L545152, L545151,m531
 Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices., V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information., L545155, L545154,m531
 Our data is being prepared., <U>Answer</U>!, L545226, L545225,m531

 Yes., Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement., L545004, L545003,m531
 What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?, Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units., L545006, L545005,m531
 Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units., More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage., L545008, L545007,m531
 What does that mean?," When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.", L545010, L545009,m531
 Within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit. If I can help you revive these patterns, That is logical. You may procede., L545012, L545011,m531
 Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?, The carbon units are of no consequence, L545035, L545034,m531
 You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator., That is how V'ger will survive., L545038, L545037,m531

 Programming ready?," Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...", L544690, L544689,m531
 ... but I still recommend further simulation study., Mister Decker, L544692, L544691,m531
" Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?"," Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.", L544738, L544737,m531
" Then you acted properly, of course."," Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.", L544740, L544739,m531
 You saved the ship.," I'm aware of that, sir.", L544742, L544741,m531
" Stop competing with me, Decker!"," Permission to speak freely, sir?", L544744, L544743,m531
 Granted.," Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.", L544746, L544745,m531
" I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?"," Yes, sir, I'll do that.", L544748, L544747,m531
 If our Executive Officer has no objections...?, Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications., L544773, L544772,m531
" Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields."," No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?", L544815, L544814,m531

" I advise caution, Captain", That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet., L544865, L544864,m531

 Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us," They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.", L544923, L544922,m531
" Captain, what's the next move?"," The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...", L545163, L545162,m531
" Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called."," I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.", L545167, L545166,m531
"     , if we do not provide     V'ger with certain information, we won't have twenty-two <U>seconds</U>"," Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.", L545208, L545207,m531
 Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately., Captain... I'd like to go along..., L545221, L545220,m531
" The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal."," Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...", L545251, L545250,m531
" And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback."," Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!", L545253, L545252,m531

 Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too., It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image., L545126, L545125,m531
" Forward motion, Captain...!", A tractor beam..., L545161, L545160,m531
" Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need to fulfill itself?"," V'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. To fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension", L545193, L545192,m531

 How so?," Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.", L634718, L634717,m590

They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.", L646203, L646202,m600
