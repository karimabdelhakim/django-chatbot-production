 SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE," Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.", L3713, L3712,m3
 CONTINUED," I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.", L3721, L3720,m3
 CONTINUED, She's wonderful., L3729, L3728,m3
 CONTINUED," Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.", L3750, L3749,m3
 CONTINUED, How did they manage to do that without any communication?, L3757, L3756,m3
 CONTINUED," I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.", L3771, L3770,m3
 CONTINUED, We're trying to get there. I hope we can., L3778, L3777,m3
" Hi. Frank... coming in, please.", Right. Just a sec., L3943, L3942,m3
 Okay. ," Okay, come on down.", L3945, L3944,m3
" Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something."," Sure, what is it?", L3964, L3963,m3
" Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.", What's up?, L3966, L3965,m3
 It's about my salary cheques., Yes?, L3968, L3967,m3
" That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18."," Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.", L3973, L3972,m3
 Really., Yes., L3975, L3974,m3
" Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.", It's possible., L3980, L3979,m3
" Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?", I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out., L3982, L3981,m3
" I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training."," No. I never did, either.", L3984, L3983,m3
 I suppose the idea was specialized training.," I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.", L3988, L3987,m3
 Oh?, Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out., L3990, L3989,m3
" No, as a matter of fact, I didn't."," Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.", L3992, L3991,m3
 I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told., That seems very unlikely., L3996, L3995,m3
" Yes, I thought so."," Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.", L3998, L3997,m3
 How?," Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.", L4000, L3999,m3
" Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training."," Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.", L4012, L4011,m3
 I know. It would be almost inconceivable., But not completely inconceivable?, L4014, L4013,m3
 I suppose it isn't logically impossible., I guess it isn't., L4016, L4015,m3
" Well, that's something."," Yes, I don't know what to make of it.", L4160, L4159,m3
 I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.," Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.", L4162, L4161,m3
 Good morning. How's it going?, Are you reasonably awake?, L4189, L4188,m3
" Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?", Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again., L4191, L4190,m3
 You're kidding., No., L4193, L4192,m3
 I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure., Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?, L4197, L4196,m3
 Two more.," Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.", L4199, L4198,m3
 Hal?, Yes., L4209, L4208,m3
 It's the last one.," Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.", L4283, L4282,m3
 I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.," I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.", L4297, L4296,m3
 I guess not., I think I'll have to go out and burn them off., L4299, L4298,m3
" I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.", He's got a point., L4007, L4006,m3
" Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem."," What is it, Hal?", L4069, L4068,m3
" The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours."," I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.", L4080, L4079,m3
" Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something."," Sure, Dave, what's up?", L4220, L4219,m3
 You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?," Yes, I know.", L4222, L4221,m3
 You probably also know that we found them okay.," Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.", L4224, L4223,m3
" I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong."," Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?", L4228, L4227,m3
" Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear."," Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.", L4230, L4229,m3
" Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history."," I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.", L4266, L4265,m3
" Well, don't worry about it.", And don't you worry about it., L4268, L4267,m3
 Is your confidence in me fully restored?," Yes, it is, Hal.", L4270, L4269,m3
" Too bad about Frank, isn't it?"," Yes, it is.", L4334, L4333,m3
" I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.", The antenna has to be replaced., L4347, L4346,m3
 Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.," It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.", L4349, L4348,m3
" If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble."," I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.", L4354, L4353,m3
" Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me."," Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.", L4356, L4355,m3
" I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest."," Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.", L4361, L4360,m3
" I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it."," Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.", L4363, L4362,m3
 I am prepared to do that anyway.," I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.", L4367, L4366,m3
 CONTINUED," Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.", L3971, L3970,m3
 CONTINUED, Did they have any explanation for this?, L3978, L3977,m3
 CONTINUED," Well, what is it?", L3994, L3993,m3
 CONINUED," Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?", L4003, L4002,m3
 CONTINUED," Still, you really don't believe it, do you?", L4010, L4009,m3
 CONTINUED," Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?", L4019, L4018,m3
" I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?"," I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?", L3669, L3668,m3
 I'm having a party tomorrow.," Yes, I know that sweetheart.", L3673, L3672,m3
 Are you coming to my party?," No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.", L3675, L3674,m3
 When are you coming home?," In three days, darling, I hope.", L3677, L3676,m3
" One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?", Mommy's out to the hair- dresser., L3680, L3679,m3
 Where is Mrs. Brown?, She's in the bathroom., L3682, L3681,m3
" Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.", How many days until you come home?, L3684, L3683,m3
" Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow."," Thank you, Daddy.", L3689, L3688,m3
" I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?"," Yes, Daddy.", L3691, L3690,m3
" 'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart."," Goodbye, Daddy.", L3693, L3692,m3
" Oh, thank you very much.", Thank you., L3798, L3797,m3
" Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.", I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later., L3806, L3805,m3
 Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.," Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.", L3808, L3807,m3
" I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.", I'll bet it's a fortune., L3810, L3809,m3
 And your charming little daughter?," Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.", L3731, L3730,m3
" Oh, that's such a delightful age.", How is gregor?, L3733, L3732,m3
 He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.," Well, where are all of you off to?", L3735, L3734,m3
 Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.," Well, that does sound very odd.", L3759, L3758,m3
 Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?," No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.", L3775, L3774,m3
" Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.", Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov., L3780, L3779,m3
" How do you do, Mr. Miller?"," I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.", L3623, L3622,m3
" Well, thank you very much for being so understanding."," Please, it really doesn't matter.", L3627, L3626,m3
 Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?," Yes, very pleasant.", L3629, L3628,m3
" Well, shall we go through Documentation?", Fine., L3631, L3630,m3
" Yes, I think so. Just about then.", I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking., L3652, L3651,m3
" Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.", Are you quite sure?, L3725, L3724,m3
" Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon"," Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?", L3739, L3738,m3
" I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean."," Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.", L3746, L3745,m3
 Really?," Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.", L3748, L3747,m3
" Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.", You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?, L3752, L3751,m3
 That's right., I see., L3754, L3753,m3
" Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention."," Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.", L3761, L3760,m3
" Fortunately, they did."," Well, I'm glad about that.", L3763, L3762,m3
" Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?", Certainly., L3767, L3766,m3
" This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.", Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this., L3773, L3772,m3
" Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?", I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement., L3869, L3868,m3
" Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.", How can you tell it was deliberately buried?, L3890, L3889,m3
 By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill., Any clue as to what it is?, L3892, L3891,m3
 But you don't have any idea as to what it is?," Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.", L3897, L3896,m3
 Any ideas about the colour?," Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?", L3905, L3904,m3
 Has it been exposed to any sun before now?," I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?", L3907, L3906,m3
" Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.", There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest., L3818, L3817,m3
 When do we arrive at Clavius?, We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?, L3820, L3819,m3
 Thank you.," Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?", L3825, L3824,m3
 What do you mean?, Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty., L3827, L3826,m3
 I see., I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?, L3829, L3828,m3
" Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her."," I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.", L3833, L3832,m3
" Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?"," No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.", L3838, L3837,m3
" Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false."," I will if I can, Frank.", L4021, L4020,m3
 Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?, True., L4023, L4022,m3
 Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?, That's true., L4025, L4024,m3
 That's true.," Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?", L4029, L4028,m3
 That's true," There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?", L4031, L4030,m3
 That's true.," Thank you very much, Hal.", L4033, L4032,m3
" Hal, have pod arms secure the component.", Roger., L4097, L4096,m3
" Five by five, Frank."," Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.", L4109, L4108,m3
 I understand.," Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.", L4111, L4110,m3
 Roger.," Hal, check all airlock doors secure.", L4113, L4112,m3
 Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors., Opening pod bay doors., L4119, L4118,m3
" Yes, Hal, what's up?", It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure., L4170, L4169,m3
" I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.", Let me see the tracking alignment display., L4175, L4174,m3
 Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?," Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.", L4182, L4181,m3
 Appipulai Leeloo Minai.., Corn-i-Lius?, L5644, L5643,m5
 What're you laughing about?, Napoleon... small., L5674, L5673,m5
 The case..with the stones... Where is it?, San Agamat chay bet... envolet!, L5679, L5678,m5
 Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!, You know exactly where they are!, L5693, L5692,m5

 ...We're saved!, I'm fucked!, L5711, L5710,m5
 Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again, I remember you now..the so called art dealer., L5738, L5737,m5
" I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?", ...Why on earth do the stones interest you?, L5740, L5739,m5
" Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...", Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you., L5742, L5741,m5
 Why?  What's wrong with me?," ...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.", L5744, L5743,m5
 ...would you like a drink?, No thank you., L5747, L5746,m5
" ...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!", They are robots!, L5752, L5751,m5
" Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!", Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another., L5755, L5754,m5
" You are a monster, Zorg!", I know..., L5761, L5760,m5
" Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.", Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations., L5614, L5613,m5
" She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.", That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?, L5616, L5615,m5
 Who are you?, I brought the girl remember?, L5621, L5620,m5
 He's a she!, You noticed..., L5625, L5624,m5
" There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!", So you do know her., L5627, L5626,m5
" They all like this in your family, father?", She's an exception.., L5649, L5648,m5
 Thank you so much for your help Mr...?, Dallas. Korben Dallas., L5651, L5650,m5
 Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!," I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?", L5653, L5652,m5
" She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.", I know. I was there when she arrived., L5655, L5654,m5
 Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?," It means, ""Never without my permission"".", L5657, L5656,m5
" I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.", Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?, L5827, L5826,m5
 We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission.., What kind of mission?, L5829, L5828,m5
 We have to save the world., Good luck.., L5831, L5830,m5
 Of course.," Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.", L5833, L5832,m5
 What are you doing?, Trying to save your ass so you can save the world., L5840, L5839,m5
 You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.," Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.", L6169, L6168,m5
 Leeloo's in trouble?, When is she not in trouble?, L6171, L6170,m5
 Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?," Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!", L6259, L6258,m5
 There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.," Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.", L6264, L6263,m5
" And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?", That's what I'm saying., L6266, L6265,m5
" Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.", One more reason to shoot first eh?, L5464, L5463,m5
 Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!," Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.", L5469, L5468,m5
" We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.", And then?, L5509, L5508,m5
 Is there anything that can stop it?, Yes..thank God.., L5512, L5511,m5
 But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?, White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity., L5516, L5515,m5
 Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.," Thank you, Mr. President.", L5522, L5521,m5
 What are we going to do?," This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.", L5557, L5556,m5
 It's a miracle!!!, What is?, L5631, L5630,m5
" Father, will you please explain what's going on?"," The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!", L5637, L5636,m5
 Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?, Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!, L5647, L5646,m5
 What's she doing?," Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.", L5672, L5671,m5
" Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..", Yes. Of course.., L5676, L5675,m5
 There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names..., I didn't know your size., L5687, L5686,m5

 What?," Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...", L24150, L24149,m14
" Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--", But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing., L24152, L24151,m14
 Does that look at all suspicious to you?, Whatever gave you that idea?, L24156, L24155,m14
 You got your vest?, Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car., L24160, L24159,m14
 Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door., I got him.  Don't get pinned., L24163, L24162,m14

 But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.," That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.", L26755, L26754,m15
 You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?," Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.", L26757, L26756,m15
 Could it be intelligent?," Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.", L26759, L26758,m15

 You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?," Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.", L26408, L26407,m15
 I hope you're right.  I really do., I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you., L26442, L26441,m15
 That the atmosphere processor?," Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.", L26476, L26475,m15

" Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?", One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?, L87836, L87835,m34
 Well?," If she is, the machine works.", L87865, L87864,m34
 How many questions did it take?, Thirteen., L87868, L87867,m34

 What?, What desert?, L87663, L87662,m34
 Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical., But how come I'd be there?, L87665, L87664,m34

 What?," When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it.", L117640, L117639,m41
 And you say he doesn't remember any of it?, Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?, L117652, L117651,m41
 Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...," Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.", L117664, L117663,m41
 Anything., A journal. Just have him write down everything he does., L117666, L117665,m41
 Why? What for?, It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days., L117668, L117667,m41

" If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.", But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?, L117701, L117700,m41
 Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.," Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.", L117703, L117702,m41
 You'd be surprised how often they are.," Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.", L117705, L117704,m41

 You know the answer to that., Can't he come out for one day?, L117618, L117617,m41
 We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him., But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad..., L117620, L117619,m41
 All the dads are gonna be there.," I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?", L117623, L117622,m41
 No., Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there., L117625, L117624,m41
" I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!", You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him., L117656, L117655,m41

" Please, mom. People will talk.", I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes., L117916, L117915,m41
 Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?, Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him., L117918, L117917,m41
 Why do you ask?," No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.", L117921, L117920,m41
" I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...", Sure..., L117924, L117923,m41
" And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...", What? What could he do?, L117926, L117925,m41
" ...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.", How long will I be in here?, L118099, L118098,m41

" Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?"," Cute, Evan.", L118158, L118157,m41
 What does that mean for Evan?," He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?", L118167, L118166,m41
 There must be a way to fix this., Fix?, L118291, L118290,m41
 You're. Acting. Like your father.," Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.", L118298, L118297,m41

" Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.", You know my father?, L117658, L117657,m41
 Dad lives here?," Not in this wing, actually. No.", L117709, L117708,m41

 It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before., Are you sure? Not even with my father?, L118160, L118159,m41
 This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex., Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?, L118164, L118163,m41
" Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.", Where are my goddamn books?, L118332, L118331,m41

" Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.", That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart., L117855, L117854,m41

 This is fun.," All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?", L152291, L152290,m47

And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.," In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.", L152293, L152292,m47

" Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe."," Yes, well...", L152316, L152315,m47

" Okay, okay, okay--"," Say the words, ""I understand.""", L154373, L154372,m48
 That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy--, Shut-up..., L154524, L154523,m48
 This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late., I was on call. , L153988, L153987,m48
 I want you on call here., What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field., L153990, L153989,m48
 More like deployed in bed asleep., I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check., L153992, L153991,m48
 And Theo can't pick up his own check because?..., He's sick., L153994, L153993,m48
 For a change., How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well., L153996, L153995,m48
 You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.," I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.", L153998, L153997,m48
" Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.", Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot., L154330, L154329,m48
 What about this?, I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot., L154332, L154331,m48
" Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.", Theo's dead., L154521, L154520,m48
" Good morning, mongrels!", Good morning..., L169005, L169004,m50
" That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, ""Good morning!""", Good MORNING!, L169007, L169006,m50
 Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!, GOOD MORNING!, L169009, L169008,m50
 Are you AFRAID?, GOOD MORNING!, L169011, L169010,m50
 Hi... what's going on here?, Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed., L169312, L169311,m50
 What happened?, He got smooshed. By a jet engine., L169314, L169313,m50
 What was his name?, Donnie. Donnie Darko., L169316, L169315,m50
 I feel bad for his family., Yeah., L169318, L169317,m50
 Dr. Monnitoff?, Donnie., L168905, L168904,m50
 So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.," So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --", L168908, L168907,m50
 Theoretically., -- and be able to find one of these wormholes., L168910, L168909,m50
" A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.", So... that's it?, L168912, L168911,m50
 Like a DeLorean., A metal craft of any kind., L168915, L168914,m50
 What effect do you think this would have on an infant?," Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.", L169069, L169068,m50
 Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity., Like a spear., L169111, L169110,m50
 Beg pardon?, Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?, L169113, L169112,m50
" Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.", Could these wormholes appear in nature?, L169115, L169114,m50
 That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God., If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path., L169117, L169116,m50
 I'm not following you.," If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?", L169119, L169118,m50
" You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.", Not if you chose to stay within God's channel..., L169121, L169120,m50
 When can I squeeze one out?, Not until like... eighth grade., L168575, L168574,m50
 Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.," When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.", L168635, L168634,m50
" What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?", You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal., L168655, L168654,m50
" ""The Last Unicorn!"" By Samantha Darko.", Donnie! Give it back!, L168711, L168710,m50
 Did you tell them that I flooded the school?, I didn't say shit., L168952, L168951,m50
 That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.," Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.", L168954, L168953,m50
 Dea ex machina..., What did you say?, L169287, L169286,m50
 How can you do that?, I can do anything I want... and so can you..., L168836, L168835,m50
 Why did you make me flood the school?, We just want to guide you in the right direction., L168851, L168850,m50
 Who is... we?, You'll know soon enough., L168853, L168852,m50
 Where did you come from?," Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?", L168855, L168854,m50
 I want to show you something., You have to do something for me first., L169080, L169079,m50
 You have a request?, Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit., L169082, L169081,m50
 Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?, Take it off. I want to see you., L169084, L169083,m50
 What happened to your eye?, I am so sorry., L169087, L169086,m50
 Why do they call you Frank?, It is the name of my father... and his father before me., L169089, L169088,m50
 How much longer is this gonna last?," You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.", L169091, L169090,m50
" DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!", We went to a hotel., L168650, L168649,m50
 My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?, I don't wanna talk about it., L168652, L168651,m50
 How old is Grandma Death?," A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.", L168829, L168828,m50
" What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!", Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine., L169307, L169306,m50
 Hey..., Hey..., L168748, L168747,m50
 Wanna walk me home?, Sure., L168751, L168750,m50
 Don't look so freaked., I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit., L168753, L168752,m50
 So... you just moved here?, Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems., L168756, L168755,m50
" Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?", He stabbed my mom four times in the chest., L168758, L168757,m50
 Wow. Did he go to jail?, He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool., L168760, L168759,m50
" I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.", Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero., L168762, L168761,m50
 I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind., That's easy. Antiseptics., L168765, L168764,m50
" I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.", You mean soap?, L168767, L168766,m50
" Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.", Wonder where we'll be then., L168769, L168768,m50
 The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect., Until it withers away., L168771, L168770,m50
 It's a good thing the school was flooded today., Why is that?, L168773, L168772,m50
 You're weird., I'm sorry., L168776, L168775,m50
 That was a compliment., Will you go with me?, L168778, L168777,m50
 Where are we going?," No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.", L168780, L168779,m50
 Where are you going?, I'm going home., L168783, L168782,m50
" So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?"," No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.", L168864, L168863,m50
 It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.," So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?", L168867, L168866,m50
 No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge., And you'd never been there before?, L168869, L168868,m50
 Donnie?, Yeah?, L168871, L168870,m50
 Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?, Why?, L168873, L168872,m50
 What happened to your neck?, I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?, L168958, L168957,m50
" Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.", Why not just buy your baby a night light?, L168962, L168961,m50
 That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.," With, like, images?", L168964, L168963,m50
 You know... we've been going together for a week and a half..., And what?, L168967, L168966,m50
 Well..., You want to kiss me..., L168969, L168968,m50
 That's alright... I understand.," No... Donnie, wait. I've never...", L168971, L168970,m50
 I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be., Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us., L168973, L168972,m50
 We're moving through time., What?, L169016, L169015,m50
 They suspended me for two days., Are you okay?, L169037, L169036,m50
 I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?, Who?, L169039, L169038,m50
" Oh, yeah.  ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"". What is this?", She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?, L169042, L169041,m50
 I know she's here. She never leaves the house., Maybe she's asleep., L169044, L169043,m50
" So, we call them... IMGs.", Infant Memory Generators., L169065, L169064,m50
" Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.", And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside., L169067, L169066,m50
 What? How long was I asleep?, The whole movie. Let's go., L169099, L169098,m50
 You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?, What's wrong with you?, L169141, L169140,m50
 Will you please talk to me?," Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.", L169169, L169168,m50
 Hey., Hey. You OK?, L169252, L169251,m50
 My mom is gone., Where is she?, L169254, L169253,m50
 I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up., But you're OK?, L169256, L169255,m50
 Did you call the cops?," Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.", L169258, L169257,m50
 I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it., It's safe here., L169260, L169259,m50
 What?," There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.", L169265, L169264,m50
 Come with me., Where are we going?, L169270, L169269,m50
 Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her., Why? Is this about the book?, L169273, L169272,m50
 No. Frank., Who's Frank?, L169275, L169274,m50
 Is that a cellar door?, Yeah..., L169280, L169279,m50
" I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.", Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline., L168888, L168887,m50
 I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple., The Lifeline is divided that way., L168890, L168889,m50
" Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.", Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions., L168892, L168891,m50
 People aren't that simple.," If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.", L168895, L168894,m50
 Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.," No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.", L168571, L168570,m50
 You're such a fuck-ass., When did you stop taking your medication?, L168583, L168582,m50
" Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?", We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table., L168588, L168587,m50
 I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?," I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.", L168597, L168596,m50
 You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today., Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?, L168599, L168598,m50
 Grandma Death., That is a terrible nickname., L168922, L168921,m50
" He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?"," Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.", L169063, L169062,m50
 I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow., Do you get to meet Ed?, L169156, L169155,m50
" If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.", How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?, L169158, L169157,m50
 So how was school today?," It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.", L168676, L168675,m50
 Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match., Do they know yet?, L168678, L168677,m50
 Know what?, Where it came from?, L168680, L168679,m50
 No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it., So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?, L168682, L168681,m50
" Oh, shit!", Grandma Death., L168685, L168684,m50
 Grandma Death.," You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.", L168924, L168923,m50
" You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.", I guess she just lost faith in the world., L168927, L168926,m50
 Who's been giving you weird looks?, A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it., L169102, L169101,m50
 You're my only son...," I know, Dad.", L169104, L169103,m50
" Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?", Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things., L168668, L168667,m50
 Who is Frank?, A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit., L168877, L168876,m50
" And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.", Why should we care?, L169132, L169131,m50
" Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.", Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?, L169134, L169133,m50
 Is the death of one species less tragic than another?, Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die., L169136, L169135,m50
 Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?," Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?", L169172, L169171,m50
 Where are you going?, I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me., L169174, L169173,m50
 That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.," Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.", L169176, L169175,m50
 What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?, Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue., L169178, L169177,m50
" What's ""Cellar Door""?"," A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that ""Cellar Door"" is the most beautiful.", L169180, L169179,m50
 Cellar door., Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going., L169182, L169181,m50
 So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?, I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me., L169184, L169183,m50
 Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.," I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.", L168689, L168688,m50
" So, I met a new friend.", Would you like to talk about this friend?, L168692, L168691,m50
 His name is Frank., Frank., L168694, L168693,m50
 I think he saved my life., How so?, L168696, L168695,m50
 Don't you watch the news?, I don't own a television., L168698, L168697,m50
 Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened., He said to follow him., L168702, L168701,m50
 Follow him where?, Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end., L168704, L168703,m50
 Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?, No.  That's stupid., L168706, L168705,m50
" And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?", Yes., L168785, L168784,m50
" So, tell me about your day, Donald.", I met a girl., L168787, L168786,m50
 What is her name?, Gretchen. We're going together now., L168789, L168788,m50
 Do you think a lot about girls?, Yes., L168791, L168790,m50
 How are things going at school?, I think about girls a lot., L168793, L168792,m50
 I asked you about school., I think about... fucking a lot during school., L168795, L168794,m50
 What else do you think about during school?," I think... about... ""Who's the Boss?""", L168797, L168796,m50
 Who is the boss?, I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano., L168799, L168798,m50
" What about your family, Donnie?"," No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!", L168801, L168800,m50
 How many times have you seen Frank?, Four times... so far., L168929, L168928,m50
 Can anyone else see him?, I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's., L168931, L168930,m50
 Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?, I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous., L168933, L168932,m50
 A sign from whom?," I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.", L168935, L168934,m50
 How does that make you feel?, It reminded me of my dog Callie., L168937, L168936,m50
 Is Callie still around?, No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch..., L168939, L168938,m50
" I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.

 Where do you live?," You're not a stalker or anything, right?", L194189, L194188,m55
" Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.", You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that., L194191, L194190,m55
 I'm not a stalker., You know Wilmont?, L194193, L194192,m55
 Yeah., Wilmont. Near the high school., L194195, L194194,m55
" Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.", It's okay. I didn't think you were., L194197, L194196,m55
" So you like bookstores, huh?", I like to read., L194199, L194198,m55
" Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.", Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --, L194201, L194200,m55
" The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. ""Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen."" Remember?"," Sort of, um...", L194203, L194202,m55
" Remember? ""And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat...""  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.", What?, L194205, L194204,m55
 Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.," Well, I wouldn't want to be --", L194208, L194207,m55
 Take care.," Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --", L194211, L194210,m55
 Um --," Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.", L194213, L194212,m55
 You like that?, Very much., L194217, L194216,m55
" Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.", Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?, L194220, L194219,m55
 I don't know.," Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.", L194222, L194221,m55
 Frost?," Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?", L194224, L194223,m55
 It's pretty.," I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!", L194226, L194225,m55
" God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.", I'm fine., L194229, L194228,m55
 Ready for another?," No, I'm okay for now.", L194232, L194231,m55
 What do you want to hear?, You pick it., L194235, L194234,m55
 You just say. I'm not really --," I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.", L194237, L194236,m55
" Well, I should probably get going."," No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?", L194241, L194240,m55
 No. I --, I know a man who needs a refill., L194243, L194242,m55
 Thanks.," Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.", L194246, L194245,m55
" Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.", Yeah?, L194249, L194248,m55
" Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?", I don't know., L194251, L194250,m55
" Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?"," Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.", L194253, L194252,m55
" Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?"," Yeah, I guess.", L194255, L194254,m55
 But I think I am. I like to think I am.," It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?", L194257, L194256,m55
 Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.," Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.", L194259, L194258,m55
" You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.", I do have a tendency to use that word too much., L194262, L194261,m55
" I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.", Thanks., L194264, L194263,m55
" And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?", Yeah., L194266, L194265,m55
" What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?", Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --, L194268, L194267,m55
 Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?, Yeah., L194270, L194269,m55
" You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?", No., L194272, L194271,m55
" I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?"," No, not at all.", L194274, L194273,m55
" Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph."," Oh, yeah.", L194277, L194276,m55
" That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.", That's scary sounding., L194279, L194278,m55
" Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?", I think so., L194281, L194280,m55
" I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.", Okay., L194283, L194282,m55
 I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --, Sounds good. But right now I should go., L194286, L194285,m55
 You should stay.," I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...", L194288, L194287,m55
 I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that., Yes., L194291, L194290,m55
" So, I enjoyed meeting you."," You'll call me, right?", L194294, L194293,m55
 Yeah., When?, L194296, L194295,m55
 Tomorrow?, Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all., L194298, L194297,m55
 How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?, You didn't say anything about my hair., L194331, L194330,m55
 Yo ho ho!, It's three., L194423, L194422,m55
 I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic., ...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic., L194427, L194426,m55
" I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.", Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something., L194430, L194429,m55
" A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?"," No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?", L194434, L194433,m55
 Let me drive you home.," Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.", L194437, L194436,m55
 How can you watch this crap?, Where are you going?, L194456, L194455,m55
 Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?, I want to have a baby., L194459, L194458,m55
 Let's talk about it later., No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby., L194461, L194460,m55
 I don't think we're ready., You're not ready., L194463, L194462,m55
 What?!, I don't want to talk about this here., L194466, L194465,m55
 You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!," Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --", L194469, L194468,m55
" Oh, thank God. It's going."," It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am!

" So, um --"," Would you get me another, Joely?", L194477, L194476,m55
 You're drunk.," You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --", L194483, L194482,m55

 I want to know you., I just don't have anything very interesting about my life., L194519, L194518,m55
 More?, No. Thanks., L194525, L194524,m55
 Joely...," Yeah, Tangerine?", L194536, L194535,m55
 Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?, No., L194538, L194537,m55
 Such a beautiful view.," Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!", L194576, L194575,m55
 Oh?," I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.", L194578, L194577,m55
" Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?", I don't know., L194580, L194579,m55
 What if you hide me?, What do you mean?, L194585, L194584,m55
" I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem.", I'm right here., L194591, L194590,m55
 I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...," Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.", L194593, L194592,m55
" You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over."," I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.", L194626, L194625,m55
 You remember what happened next?," I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --", L194628, L194627,m55
 There's this guy!, What?, L194631, L194630,m55
" There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.", Really? Is he cute?, L194633, L194632,m55
 He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!," Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.", L194635, L194634,m55
" But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.", Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally., L194660, L194659,m55
 They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now., Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?, L194663, L194662,m55
" Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?"," This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.", L194668, L194667,m55

 Happy Birthday.," Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!", L194685, L194684,m55
 I scoured the city for it., I love it!, L194688, L194687,m55
" I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.", Yeah., L194744, L194743,m55
 I want to enjoy my little time left with you.," This is our first ""date"" date.", L194746, L194745,m55
 Do you remember what we talked about?," Naomi, I guess.", L194748, L194747,m55
 Yeah., What was I wearing?, L194750, L194749,m55
" God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper."," Egad, were you horrified?", L194752, L194751,m55
 Right. Something black though., I'll buy that. Black's always good., L194756, L194755,m55
 We did talk about Naomi., I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure., L194758, L194757,m55
" I'm sure, I said.", But you weren't. I could tell., L194760, L194759,m55
 I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:," So what. Infatuation is good, too.", L194763, L194762,m55
 I dropped you off after. You said --, Come up and see me... now., L194766, L194765,m55
 It's very late.," Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.", L194768, L194767,m55
 I told her today I need to end it., Is that what you want?, L194787, L194786,m55
" I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.", Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you., L194805, L194804,m55

" Well, you're married.", Not yet. Not married., L194809, L194808,m55
" Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.", Okay., L194811, L194810,m55
" Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.", I remember that speech really well., L194815, L194814,m55
" I had you pegged, didn't I?", You had the whole human race pegged., L194817, L194816,m55
 Probably., I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that., L194819, L194818,m55
 I know.," It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.", L194821, L194820,m55
 Hi there., Hi., L194863, L194862,m55
 You said...," I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.", L194866, L194865,m55
 Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.," I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.", L194868, L194867,m55
 You know what I did.," Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.", L194875, L194874,m55
 I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?, And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers., L194878, L194877,m55
" Oh God, how horrid.", I'm Joel., L194882, L194881,m55
" You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?"," Yeah, like that.", L194886, L194885,m55

 What do we do?, Enjoy it. Say good-bye., L194891, L194890,m55
" No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.", I know what you mean. That's why I stopped., L194895, L194894,m55
 But my sleeping is really fucked up., I don't think I've slept in a year., L194897, L194896,m55
" You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.", yeah?, L194899, L194898,m55
 I'll give you a couple. See what you think., Okay., L194901, L194900,m55
 Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?, I love her., L194903, L194902,m55
" Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.", I think she's great., L194905, L194904,m55
 Me too. There's this poem --, Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?, L194907, L194906,m55
" I think, before.", Seems too coincidental that way., L194909, L194908,m55
" Do you know her poem that starts ""Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live..."," Yeah, yeah. It goes ""Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines""?", L194912, L194911,m55
 I wish we did. You married?," Um, no.", L194915, L194914,m55

 Cool., What are you doing?, L194923, L194922,m55
" C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.", I hesitated for what seemed like forever., L194928, L194927,m55
 I knew., I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass., L194932, L194931,m55
 It's dark., Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?, L194934, L194933,m55
" Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.", I think we should go., L194937, L194936,m55
 So go.," I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, ""so go"" with such disdain.", L194942, L194941,m55
 What if you stay this time?, I walked out the door. There's no more memory., L194944, L194943,m55

 Have sex. Y'know --," Oh, um...", L195036, L195035,m55
 Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now., That's okay. I --, L195038, L195037,m55
 I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --," Hey, Joel --", L195040, L195039,m55

 Doesn't sound like me.," Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.", L195069, L195068,m55
" Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?", I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic., L195071, L195070,m55
" You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my ""gratuitous need to shock.""", I can't stop thinking about you., L195098, L195097,m55

" The driver waved. So casual, friendly.", I'm like a joke to them., L194304, L194303,m55
 I might be making a mistake.," Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened.

 Naomi.," On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun", L194779, L194778,m55

" Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?", There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand., L222623, L222622,m63

" Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?", I don't know., L222630, L222629,m63

" Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking."," I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.

 Have you seen Willie?, Is he not back yet?, L222543, L222542,m63

 Are you sure it can't hurt us?, Nothing can. Not ever., L222145, L222144,m63
 How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?, It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will., L222163, L222162,m63
 What kind of God is He to will this?, She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone., L222165, L222164,m63
 God took her from us., He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother, L222167, L222166,m63

 Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there., I'll have to do better than that., L222198, L222197,m63
" You will.  What do you want, Victor?", To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear..., L222200, L222199,m63
 I've loved you all my life, All my life I've known., L222204, L222203,m63

" Victor. I love you,", Elizabeth. My more than sister., L222223, L222222,m63
 My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come., But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?, L222594, L222593,m63
 I've no choice," If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!", L222596, L222595,m63

" We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude."," A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved.

" No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.", Why the change? What about your work?, L222679, L222678,m63
 It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?, It is, L222681, L222680,m63
" We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.", Does this have something to do with that man you saw?, L222683, L222682,m63

 Brother and sister no more., Now husband and wife., L222709, L222708,m63
 I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then., I have been waiting for this ever since., L222711, L222710,m63
 Victor!, Open this door for no-one!, L222713, L222712,m63
 It's going to ram us., It wouldn't dare., L222085, L222084,m63
" Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.", They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now., L222108, L222107,m63
 A warming wind., This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?, L222752, L222751,m63

" I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.", Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?, L222335, L222334,m63

 I was just clearing my throat., Very well then., L222243, L222242,m63

 The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.," You're a comfort to me, Henry.", L222276, L222275,m63

 Now you've got him started.," These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought", L222287, L222286,m63

 They'll hang him all the same., Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap., L222358, L222357,m63

 All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!, No. He had more important work., L222368, L222367,m63
 Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class., I've been preoccupied., L222375, L222374,m63
 We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life., That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory., L222377, L222376,m63
 How much longer?, Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now., L222379, L222378,m63

" Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens."," No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.", L239574, L239573,m75
 Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.," Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?", L239579, L239578,m75
" What do you mean by ""seen?""", Looked at with your eyes., L239581, L239580,m75
" Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once."," Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.", L239583, L239582,m75
 What is it?, It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly., L239607, L239606,m75
 I told you it's real., What do we do now?, L239610, L239609,m75
 I don't know.  Talk to it., What do I say?, L239612, L239611,m75
 Anything!  Just make contact.," Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.", L239614, L239613,m75
" ""Get her?""  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?"," I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?", L239623, L239622,m75
" If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize."," If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.", L239632, L239631,m75
 You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting.," Ray, I apologize.  I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced.  They did this to Galileo, too.", L239642, L239641,m75
 This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod., You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress., L239645, L239644,m75
" Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there."," Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.", L239647, L239646,m75
 For what purpose?, To go into business for ourselves., L239649, L239648,m75
" You'll never regret this, Ray."," My parents left me that house, I was born there.", L239652, L239651,m75
 You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days., But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy., L239654, L239653,m75
 But most people are afraid to even report these things., Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before., L239658, L239657,m75
 Wow!  Does this pole still work?," This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of ""pricey"" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company.", L239663, L239662,m75
 Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?, Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?, L239696, L239695,m75
 Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence., Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?, L239730, L239729,m75
 How was your date?, It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation., L239778, L239777,m75
 They will., Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem., L239782, L239781,m75
 So do I., No sense worrying about it now., L239813, L239812,m75
" I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.", So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy., L239821, L239820,m75
 Ray -- Something's here.," Where are you, Pete?", L239838, L239837,m75

" It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.", Don't move.  It won't hurt you., L239843, L239842,m75
 How do you know?, I don't know.  I'm just guessing., L239845, L239844,m75

" Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?"," It's not good, Pete.", L240006, L240005,m75
" I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?", No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy., L240174, L240173,m75
 Who was the architect?, He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor., L240176, L240175,m75
 It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any., I don't think it's Shandor., L240252, L240251,m75
" As a duly-constituted representative of the City of New York, and on behalf of the County and State of New York, the United States of America, the Planet Earth and all its inhabitants, I hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension."," Well, that ought to do it.", L240255, L240254,m75
" Agile bastard, isn't he?", Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!, L240262, L240261,m75
 I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!, What?  What popped in there?, L240279, L240278,m75
 AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?, The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!, L240286, L240285,m75
" Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ...

Now tell me what you really do.", L239968, L239967,m75
 Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?, Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual., L240068, L240067,m75
" Are you a Christian, Ray?", Mmmhmmm., L240070, L240069,m75

" Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?", And the seas would boil ..., L240078, L240077,m75
 Right.  And the sky would fall ..., Judgement Day ..., L240080, L240079,m75
" Yeah, Judgement Day.", Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world., L240082, L240081,m75
" You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.", Right.  We'll believe anything., L240088, L240087,m75

 How do you want us?, Up there., L352877, L352876,m122
 All right. Now you keep your bargain., Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!, L352884, L352883,m122
 How did they get in here?, Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started., L352888, L352887,m122
 What other food?," Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.", L352890, L352889,m122
" It's a real privilege, Sandman.", Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red., L352729, L352728,m122
 I am., Your own work?, L352731, L352730,m122
 I designed it myself.  What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?, Just the face., L352734, L352733,m122
 Do you have anything special in mind?, I don't care... Just get it over with., L352750, L352749,m122
 You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?," Turn this way.  No, no... not you... YOU!", L352393, L352392,m122
 You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect.  I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?," Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!", L352395, L352394,m122
 Had enough?, Even the alarm didn't wake him., L352404, L352403,m122
 You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6., Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?, L352408, L352407,m122
 Why?, Just wondered... what happens?, L352411, L352410,m122
" But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. ""One for one. One for one."""," Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?", L352414, L352413,m122
" No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that ""one for one"" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape."," Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.  You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman.", L352416, L352415,m122
 Did you ever see Francis-8?," I never even visited Nursery before tonight.  When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?", L352423, L352422,m122
 I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?," Of course not! I'm curious, not sick. ", L352425, L352424,m122
 You missed something special., Well... you can't have them all., L352439, L352438,m122
 The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade...," What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than --  come on, Sandman.", L352442, L352441,m122
" You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --"," Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...", L352444, L352443,m122
 Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother., Only a few? You're just not trying., L352449, L352448,m122
 Who invited you?, I'm in my party mood., L352457, L352456,m122
 That was a great shot you made.," Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?", L352460, L352459,m122
 I just might look in on New You 483 myself., You? Why? You're already beautiful., L352522, L352521,m122
 What the hell took you so long?, Did you ever see anybody renew?, L352552, L352551,m122
 I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions., Did you?, L352554, L352553,m122
 Of course., Anybody we know?, L352556, L352555,m122
 Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do., I'm fine...  See you..., L352558, L352557,m122
" What's going on, Logan?!", It has nothing to do with you., L352766, L352765,m122
 Why did you do that??!!," I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...", L353024, L353023,m122
 It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.," No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!", L352797, L352796,m122
" He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.", Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --, L352799, L352798,m122
" That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!"," ...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...", L352801, L352800,m122
 What's your name?, I'm Mary 2., L352658, L352657,m122
" Where do you live, Mary?", Here., L352660, L352659,m122
 Why aren't you in Nursery?, I'm very smart., L352662, L352661,m122
 When do you go up?, I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady., L352664, L352663,m122
" What's wrong, Available?", Please... No., L352464, L352463,m122
" Please... no?  You mean ""not here"" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.", No.  Just no., L352466, L352465,m122
 You prefer women?, No., L352468, L352467,m122
 Well then...?," Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.", L352470, L352469,m122
 Sad? What made you sad?, A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone., L352472, L352471,m122
 Yes... probably he was renewed?, He was killed., L352474, L352473,m122
 Killed? Why do you use that word?, Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill., L352476, L352475,m122
 I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?, Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit., L352478, L352477,m122
 You felt sad. What's your name?, Jessica., L352480, L352479,m122
 You're beautiful. Let's have sex., No., L352482, L352481,m122
 Later., No., L352484, L352483,m122
 But you put yourself on the circuit!, I thought I had to do something., L352486, L352485,m122
 And?, I changed my mind., L352488, L352487,m122
 And now?, Curious., L352490, L352489,m122
 About what?, How a Sandman lives., L352492, L352491,m122
 Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious., Not about that., L352494, L352493,m122
 I'm listening., I'm afraid to tell you., L352496, L352495,m122
 I'm not armed.  Well?, Why is it wrong to run?, L352498, L352497,m122
 You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --, I suppose. But what if you want to live?, L352500, L352499,m122
 But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in., I didn't say that I would run... I just..., L352504, L352503,m122
 Are you a 5 or a 6? , Six. I go red next year., L352506, L352505,m122
 What Quad do you live in?, K., L352509, L352508,m122
 You could have called me yourself., But I wasn't sure you'd come., L352564, L352563,m122
 I couldn't get you out of my mind.," I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?", L352567, L352566,m122
 Maybe... sure..., Thanks... but I have the choice., L352569, L352568,m122
 Of course., Then it's still no., L352571, L352570,m122
 You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?, You know., L352573, L352572,m122
 I don't believe you. There has to be more., All right., L352575, L352574,m122
 Why show me?, I'm going to run., L352577, L352576,m122
 Why tell me?, You know something., L352579, L352578,m122
" About running, dying what?", Both... running's what I'm interested in., L352581, L352580,m122
 I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has., It's different now. Help me., L352583, L352582,m122
 Where did you get that?, A Runner gave it to me., L352586, L352585,m122
" And then you killed him, right?", I let him go... believe me., L352588, L352587,m122
 I don't..," Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...", L352590, L352589,m122
 Please? What friends?, I don't have much time., L352592, L352591,m122
 I never heard of a Sandman running... ever..., And I never heard of Sanctuary., L352594, L352593,m122
 Are you here to help me?, What do you need?, L352618, L352617,m122
 What're you going to do?, That's tomorrow., L352620, L352619,m122
 I wish I could help you., Maybe you'll think of something..., L352622, L352621,m122
" If you did know, you'd tell me.", Of course --, L352625, L352624,m122
" If you trusted me, you'd know.", We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?, L352627, L352626,m122
 A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.," You're not going, are you?", L352631, L352630,m122
 I'd rather be with you., That's nice., L352634, L352633,m122
 They're like beasts. Wild., Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders., L352637, L352636,m122
 Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral., Some people say children need human mothering., L352639, L352638,m122
 Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be., I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?, L352641, L352640,m122
 Uh-uh., I have., L352643, L352642,m122
 When did you begin to question Lastday?," I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?", L352645, L352644,m122
 Just follow -- no matter how it seems..., But what is this -- why?, L352652, L352651,m122
" The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast", Muscle? I don't know that one., L352654, L352653,m122
 I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed., Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?, L352699, L352698,m122
" Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.", All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner., L352701, L352700,m122
" Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now..."," That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.", L352703, L352702,m122
 I -- I can't., Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain, L352705, L352704,m122
 Are you taking me to them?, Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --, L352771, L352770,m122
 Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.," He's good, isn't he?", L352773, L352772,m122
 Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others.  You know there's only one place to go now..., They won't believe us., L352775, L352774,m122
 I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis., They won't listen., L352777, L352776,m122
" You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,", We'll convince them., L352779, L352778,m122
" Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.", How will they know we're coming?, L352782, L352781,m122
 Will you take me with you?," Why, Jessica? You're still a green.", L352815, L352814,m122
 How do we know this is the right way?, It's the only way., L352823, L352822,m122
 What do you suppose this was...?," Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.", L352825, L352824,m122
 I'm afraid.," It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.", L352831, L352830,m122
 I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?, It doesn't make any difference anymore., L352834, L352833,m122
" You're really one of us now, aren't you?"," You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?", L352836, L352835,m122
 I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?, I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed., L352838, L352837,m122
" Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.", I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now., L352840, L352839,m122
 What's that?, It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving., L352900, L352899,m122
 I hate outside! I hate it!, We'll be all right...  We will..., L352904, L352903,m122
 Don't!," Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.", L352906, L352905,m122
 It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired., Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these., L352909, L352908,m122
 Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?, I doubt it., L352912, L352911,m122
 Don't ever let go., I won't., L352914, L352913,m122
 It all seemed to make sense until Box., Do you think he was telling the Truth?, L352916, L352915,m122
" Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.", How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back., L352918, L352917,m122
 You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.," Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?", L352920, L352919,m122
 What does it mean?, The Lifeclocks have no power outside., L352923, L352922,m122
 You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?," You know, Jessica.", L352925, L352924,m122
 ...But I still have the choice...?, Of course., L352927, L352926,m122
 I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.," Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad?", L352930, L352929,m122
 They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?," ""Beloved Husband"". ""Beloved Wife"". What can all that mean?", L352934, L352933,m122
 Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?, It could be..., L352939, L352938,m122
 That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?, He had a mother and father -- and he knew them., L353003, L353002,m122
 There's a Sanctuary... there is!, You want there to be one... that doesn't..., L353009, L353008,m122
 There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!," No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes ""real"". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.", L353011, L353010,m122
 What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?, He asked if we would bury him when his time comes., L353041, L353040,m122
 We can't. We're going back., To what?, L353043, L353042,m122
 I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --, You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!, L353045, L353044,m122
 Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!," Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!", L353047, L353046,m122
 Things change!," You want to go back to kill, is that it?! Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! Kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!", L353049, L353048,m122
 Jessica... listen to me... listen to me...  The Lifeclocks made me kill Francis. They make people die or be killed every day. If I didn't try and destroy that... I couldn't live here or anywhere. Do you understand?," I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want.", L353051, L353050,m122
" ""Beloved son""...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?"," Yes. You and I, Jessica. ", L353074, L353073,m122
 And Sanctuary?," Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...", L353076, L353075,m122
 Beloved husband..., Beloved wife..., L353078, L353077,m122
 What does that water do?, It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow., L353080, L353079,m122
 Is it inside the city?, Of course.  I don't know where...  I just took them for granted.  It's our only chance., L353082, L353081,m122
" Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.", But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately., L352953, L352952,m122
 And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?, Yes..., L352971, L352970,m122
 Are you sure?, Mother and Father said so... you know?, L352973, L352972,m122
 What kind of jewel is this?, I don't know., L352986, L352985,m122
 You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?, No., L352988, L352987,m122
 What belongs to the people?, All this. All of it., L352997, L352996,m122
 What people?, I don't know... but it does., L352999, L352998,m122
 We'll have to bury him., What's that?, L353030, L353029,m122
 I'll make the arrangements., At least it's over..., L353033, L353032,m122
 Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise..., We'll remember. But that's a long time off..., L353039, L353038,m122
 Come with us., Where are you going?, L353056, L353055,m122
 Goodbye.," Oh, my...", L353090, L353089,m122
" Hello, Sandman.", Hello., L352713, L352712,m122
 We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here., A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?, L352716, L352715,m122
 I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else., It's all right with me. Is he here?, L352718, L352717,m122
 My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?," No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.", L352720, L352719,m122
 How long have you been living here?, For as long as I can remember., L352958, L352957,m122

 My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?, Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?, L352969, L352968,m122
 Where are they?, Dead... they're dead... and buried., L352975, L352974,m122
 They're beautiful. May I have one too please?, No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible., L352980, L352979,m122

 Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?," Never, never, ever. Nothing.", L352993, L352992,m122
 May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest., Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people., L352995, L352994,m122
 Are you ready to put him in?, Not yet., L353035, L353034,m122
 We're leaving., What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me., L353054, L353053,m122

 Left behind?," When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.", L545963, L545962,m191

 Chase me!, For what purpose?, L536848, L536847,m195
 Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it., But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second..., L536850, L536849,m195

 ... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence., What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku..., L536655, L536654,m195

" I'm showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation, Captain...", Will the structure hold if we blast through?, L536933, L536932,m195
 Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be..., Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk..., L536386, L536385,m195

 It isn't safe for you to remain in this area., He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies..., L536467, L536466,m195
 Take me down. Let me talk to Picard., Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force., L536814, L536813,m195

If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation..."," Federation support, Federation procedures, Federation rules... look in the mirror, Admiral... the Federation is old... in the last twenty four months, it's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion... they all smell the scent of death on the Federation. That's why you've embraced our offer... because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well, how badly do you want it, Admiral? Because there are hard choices to be made now. If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave Captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless Ba'ku, your Federation politicians will waver, your Federation opinion polls will open a public debate, your Federation allies will want their say... need I go on?", L536816, L536815,m195
 I'll order Riker to turn around., Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?, L536820, L536819,m195

 You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?, ... And now he's holding our people hostage down there..., L536372, L536371,m195
" The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...", That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region, L536374, L536373,m195
 What kind of concerns?, We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out., L536376, L536375,m195
" Captain, I wasn't expecting you."," This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...", L536460, L536459,m195

I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...", L536743, L536742,m195
 I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council., How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?, L536745, L536744,m195
 The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution., Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?, L536747, L536746,m195
 There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings..., A planet in Federation space..., L536749, L536748,m195
 Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners., Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs., L536751, L536750,m195
" On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...", Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago., L536753, L536752,m195
" With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?", There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be..., L536755, L536754,m195
" The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.", Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology., L536757, L536756,m195
 Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this., Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do..., L536759, L536758,m195
" It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?", The Ba'ku., L536761, L536760,m195
 We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded... this is an attack on the very soul of the Federation.  This will destroy the Ba'ku. Just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.," We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.", L536763, L536762,m195

 I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial..., There's nothing further to be gained from this..., L536996, L536995,m195
 A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me., Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?, L537031, L537030,m195
 What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo..., Do you know how to disable the injector?, L537035, L537034,m195

Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we'll need their help..., L537039, L537038,m195
 The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override..., Scan for lifesigns., L537095, L537094,m195
 Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?," No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...", L536770, L536769,m195

 They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters..., Recommendations?, L536812, L536811,m195
 There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them., We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation..., L536818, L536817,m195
 Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?, May I talk to you alone?, L537017, L537016,m195
 Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...," No one hated them more than you, Gal'na.  We've come a long way together. This is the moment we've planned for so many years...", L537020, L537019,m195
 Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them..., The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction..., L537022, L537021,m195
 I want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows. I'll ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can join us. We're going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the Goren system.," They... are in opposite directions, sir...", L536382, L536381,m195

 I took these out of Data's neural net... they contain memory engrams..., Do you know how they were damaged?, L536579, L536578,m195
" By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.", The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned., L536581, L536580,m195
 I don't believe it happened that way., Why would they fire at him without provocation?, L536583, L536582,m195
" All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...", Fail-safe?, L536585, L536584,m195
 His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...," So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.", L536587, L536586,m195
" In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.", And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat..., L536589, L536588,m195
 Implants bothering you?, It's nothing. I'm just tired., L536591, L536590,m195

 Will that stop the tear?," You got me, Commander.", L536914, L536913,m195
 That's your expert opinion?, Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned., L536916, L536915,m195
 We're pulling it like a zipper across space..., Options?, L536911, L536910,m195

" Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.", On my way., L540707, L540706,m198
" My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.", Good work. The download?, L540783, L540782,m198
" A bit less florid, Data."," Aye, sir... This way.", L540787, L540786,m198
 A weapon., It would appear so., L540790, L540789,m198
 Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise., It'll only work for one of us., L540792, L540791,m198
" Yes, sir.", We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?, L540794, L540793,m198
" Alacrity would be appreciated, Commander.", They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and..., L540800, L540799,m198
 What do you imagine this is?," Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?", L540804, L540803,m198
 Can you open the shuttlebay doors?," Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.", L540806, L540805,m198
 Do you think this is a wise course of action?, We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark., L540809, L540808,m198
" Ready, Captain.", Fire!, L540811, L540810,m198
 How long until we reach the fleet?, At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes., L540888, L540887,m198
" ""For now we see but through a glass darkly..."" He said he's a mirror.", Of you?, L540890, L540889,m198
 Yes.," I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.", L540892, L540891,m198
 But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.," He would deny a ""human"" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.", L540894, L540893,m198
" He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin"," No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.", L540896, L540895,m198
 How can you be sure?," I aspire, sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon.", L540898, L540897,m198
 We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it., It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?, L540901, L540900,m198
" Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications."," Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!", L540903, L540902,m198
 We are losing dorsal shields., Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers!, L540915, L540914,m198
" Captain, we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine.", Divert power and compensate., L541006, L541005,m198
 We are being hailed.," Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.", L541022, L541021,m198
" Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here.", Negative., L541054, L541053,m198
 Why am I looking at me?, You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me., L540400, L540399,m198
 You have a red shirt., This is not an appropriate time for a conversation., L540418, L540417,m198
 Why?, Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle., L540420, L540419,m198
" Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.", How many of you did Dr. Soong make?, L540359, L540358,m198
 Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.," Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .", L540375, L540374,m198
" Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment.  The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. IÆd say he's a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data ."," Do you have a name, sir?", L540430, L540429,m198
 At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state., I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download., L540505, L540504,m198
" Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.", He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?, L540507, L540506,m198
" I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual."," An individual more like you, you mean.", L540509, L540508,m198
 Yes., Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is., L540511, L540510,m198
 What purpose does this serve?, It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?, L540524, L540523,m198
 Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions., It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?, L540526, L540525,m198
 But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.," Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.", L540529, L540528,m198
" We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.", Emergency force fields are holding., L540989, L540988,m198
 What is our approximate distance?, , L541062, L541061,m198
 It appears to be...  ... an arm., Why is it moving?, L540387, L540386,m198
 It's you., The resemblance is... striking., L540398, L540397,m198
 No., I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?, L540403, L540402,m198
 If you wouldn't mind., Thank you., L540411, L540410,m198
" Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast."," The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... IÆm a talking head.", L540279, L540278,m198
 And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know., The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed., L540281, L540280,m198
 May I have this dance?," With pleasure, Captain.", L540289, L540288,m198
 Counselor.," Do you have a moment, sir?", L540463, L540462,m198
" It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a ""family"" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.", You're speaking of emotional investment?, L540466, L540465,m198
" The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations."," As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.", L540468, L540467,m198
 I'm going to miss you., And I you., L540471, L540470,m198
" I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.", Is he sincere about wanting peace?, L540607, L540606,m198
" Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.", How could I not?, L540610, L540609,m198
" Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him."," I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!", L540612, L540611,m198
 Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties., Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I..., L540732, L540731,m198

 Captain -- I might have a way to find them., Counselor?, L540992, L540991,m198
 The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me., Make it so., L540994, L540993,m198
 But how can he? He'll kill you., This isn't about me anymore., L541049, L541048,m198
 I'm only half human.," Deanna Troi of Betazed. Empathic and telepathic abilities, ship's counselor. All of this I knew... But I didn't know you were so beautiful.", L540570, L540569,m198
 Imzadi. This is so good., No!, L540619, L540618,m198
 He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you., This isn't real., L540621, L540620,m198
 I'll always be with you now. Now and forever., You sick bastard!, L540625, L540624,m198
 You're not here.," Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me.", L540712, L540711,m198
 No.," I can feel your desire, Deanna.", L540714, L540713,m198
" Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?"," Your timing is impeccable, Commander.", L540963, L540962,m198
 The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.," When this is over, I owe you a drink.", L540965, L540964,m198
" I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.", Do you have life support?, L540985, L540984,m198

 Open a channel., This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies., L541077, L541076,m198
 It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system., What do we know about the planet?, L540355, L540354,m198
 Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan., Theories?, L540357, L540356,m198
" I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.", What do we know about the population?, L540373, L540372,m198
 Cannon fodder., Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it., L540497, L540496,m198
 It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship., What programs were accessed?, L540685, L540684,m198
 That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts," Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.", L540687, L540686,m198
 I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.," Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.", L540691, L540690,m198
 It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet., And that's exactly what he's going to do., L540858, L540857,m198
 He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent., What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?, L541012, L541011,m198
 What's he doing?, He wants to look me in the eye., L541016, L541015,m198
 He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do., Sir?, L541018, L541017,m198
" Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me."," Aye, sir.", L541029, L541028,m198
" Deanna, on my mark."," Ready, sir!", L541031, L541030,m198

 New Praetor?, There's more... as always. He's Reman., L540480, L540479,m198

" So, human... you've met your better self!", What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?, L540772, L540771,m198
 I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours., That will never happen., L540774, L540773,m198
 It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest., There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species., L540777, L540776,m198
 I won't do it.," WonÆt do what, Mister Worf?", L540348, L540347,m198

" Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command.", Acknowledged ...  ...I'll talk to Data., L540473, L540472,m198
 We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators., A coup d'etat?, L540499, L540498,m198
 Why don't they answer our hails?," It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.", L540534, L540533,m198

" He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.", Can anything be done for him?, L540834, L540833,m198
 Sir?, His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth., L540860, L540859,m198
 Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled., And the Romulans invade., L540862, L540861,m198

" Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.", I would be interested to know what we are talking about., L540577, L540576,m198

" We need to talk, just you and I.", Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us., L540596, L540595,m198

 You don't trust me., I have no reason to., L540653, L540652,m198
 Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... youÆd be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would., And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions., L540655, L540654,m198

Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.", I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence., L540674, L540673,m198
" In time, Jean Luc.", In time., L540676, L540675,m198
" Hello, Jean Luc.", Why am I here?, L540735, L540734,m198
 What are you doing?, I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. , L540739, L540738,m198
 All of this so you could capture me?," Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ...  You may go.", L540742, L540741,m198
 Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.  Or maybe IÆll snap its ugly head off., What's this all about?, L540746, L540745,m198
" It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...", You're not Reman., L540748, L540747,m198
 And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?, I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is., L540750, L540749,m198
" I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.", I won't defend my life to you., L540752, L540751,m198
 My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?, If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation., L540754, L540753,m198
" Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest."," Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?", L540756, L540755,m198
 It amazes me how little you know yourself.," I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.", L540758, L540757,m198
" You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.", We are., L540925, L540924,m198
" It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.", Why are you here?, L540927, L540926,m198
 To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship., And what of the Enterprise?, L540929, L540928,m198
" I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.", You know that's not possible., L540931, L540930,m198
 I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.," Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.", L540933, L540932,m198
" I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.", Long ago., L540935, L540934,m198
 Not so long.," Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.", L540937, L540936,m198
 The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!, He is what his life has made him!, L540941, L540940,m198
 Yes.," So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?", L540946, L540945,m198
 I don't know., But you want to., L540948, L540947,m198
 That's your life... not mine., Please., L540951, L540950,m198
 ItÆs too late., You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!, L540953, L540952,m198
" I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.", I am., L541024, L541023,m198
" Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.", On my way., L540722, L540721,m198
 Report!," Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!", L540958, L540957,m198
 Target disruptors. Destroy them.," Disruptors are off-line, sir.", L541040, L541039,m198
 Deploy the weapon. Kill everything on that ship. Then set a course for Earth., What about Picard?, L541042, L541041,m198
" Our greater goal is more important, brother."," But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...", L541044, L541043,m198
" Well, that sounds relaxing too.", It is... invigorating., L540456, L540455,m198
 So theyÆve got him up and running., He's a very unusual android., L540458, L540457,m198
 My God..., Should I raise shields?, L540544, L540543,m198
 Minimal damage to the Scimitar.," Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.", L540917, L540916,m198
" Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.", We're being hailed., L540960, L540959,m198
 Intruder alert!, Let's go., L541008, L541007,m198
 Are we prepared?," Yes, Praetor.", L540339, L540338,m198
 This is a mistake., He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor., L540678, L540677,m198
" Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.", My time. I'll spend it how I choose., L540680, L540679,m198
 The bond is broken., Find her again., L540718, L540717,m198
 No -- this is wasting time., Do as I tell you!, L540720, L540719,m198
 It's accelerating. You have no more time for games., Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.', L540724, L540723,m198
 How long?, A matter of hours now., L540882, L540881,m198
 How long until we reach the Rift?, Seven minutes., L540885, L540884,m198
 Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop., What?!, L540976, L540975,m198
 Praetor..., FULL STOP AND FIRE !, L540982, L540981,m198
 What is it?!! Focus on your job!!, She is here., L540999, L540998,m198
" Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?", They're holding position., L540322, L540321,m198
 And?," They will obey, Praetor.", L540324, L540323,m198
 How many Warbirds will you need?, None., L540332, L540331,m198
" Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.", The Scimitar will serve my needs., L540334, L540333,m198
 But surely..., I came this far alone ..., L540336, L540335,m198
 Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!, You don't have to understand., L540628, L540627,m198
 And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?, I have a purpose., L540630, L540629,m198
 Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?," Silence, Romulan!", L540632, L540631,m198
" You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guardÆs whip and you'll soon understand patience.", Praetor., L540634, L540633,m198
 The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space., , L540816, L540815,m198
" I thought we discussed patience, Commander."," And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--", L540818, L540817,m198
" Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?", For the moment., L540820, L540819,m198
" Benny, God, take it easy...", I don't want to scare them away., L542517, L542516,m199
 Right in line with that burning tree., I don't see anything., L542522, L542521,m199
" Benny, there's nothing there.", There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses., L542525, L542524,m199
 What did I tell you?, Probably kids., L542530, L542529,m199
 Don't you think you should call a backup?," No, we can handle this.", L542533, L542532,m199
" Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right?", I don't think so... , L542545, L542544,m199
 Gate three. It's boarding now., Thank you., L542955, L542954,m199
 What can I do for you folks?, How much are your rooms?, L543085, L543084,m199
 You have one with two beds?, Sure., L543088, L543087,m199
 I'll take that., Fill this out.  Will this be cash or credit card?, L543090, L543089,m199
 Credit card., I'll have to run your card off now., L543092, L543091,m199
 We're only going to be here a few hours..., It's still the full price., L543094, L543093,m199
 Do you have a good map of Death Valley?, We should have. Let me see., L543352, L543351,m199
 Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money., I understand., L543166, L543165,m199
 What do you do?, I make maps., L543168, L543167,m199
" Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?", Eh... yes., L543170, L543169,m199
 Make any money?, No., L543172, L543171,m199
 Do you have children?, No., L543179, L543178,m199
 What do you think of America?, It is beautiful., L543182, L543181,m199
" Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.", Thank you., L543241, L543240,m199
 No!!! No!!!, He's got a gun!!, L543117, L543116,m199
 Where did you stop last?, What the hell do you think you're doing?, L543146, L543145,m199
 Where did you stop last?, Stay right there..., L543148, L543147,m199
 What was your last stop?, Elmo's..., L543150, L543149,m199
 Where's that?, About five miles back., L543152, L543151,m199
" We're going... Damn!  We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?"," Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?", L542589, L542588,m199
 Recognize this?, It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes., L542619, L542618,m199
 Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit., They must have picked it up in space., L542621, L542620,m199
" It's real, George.", There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?, L542582, L542581,m199
 I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and..., Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?, L542584, L542583,m199
 None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...," Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.", L542586, L542585,m199
" We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.", I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need., L542592, L542591,m199
 Contain it and get back to me., What do you mean by 'contain?', L542595, L542594,m199
 Then it's not an accident that they found us., We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact., L542623, L542622,m199
 Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?, We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for., L542625, L542624,m199
" That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us."," We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.", L542627, L542626,m199
" Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone."," You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.", L542629, L542628,m199
" George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.", When can we expect containment?, L542744, L542743,m199
" Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...", It's in a green Mustang?, L542746, L542745,m199
 Why did you let it get into a populated area?, It's taken on a disguise., L542751, L542750,m199
 Clarify that., It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband., L542753, L542752,m199
 The extraterrestrial now looks like this., Oh shit!!!, L542756, L542755,m199
" You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...", I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk., L542883, L542882,m199
" I don't like it, George...", Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?, L542885, L542884,m199
 It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed..., We don't know what else to do. We need results., L542887, L542886,m199
" You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.", I'm gonna be here if you need anything., L542889, L542888,m199
 We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.," I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.", L543133, L543132,m199
 I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.," George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.", L543135, L543134,m199
" Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...", Is that what's affecting your performance?, L543138, L543137,m199
" I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it."," You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.", L543140, L543139,m199
 Hello George., Shermin..., L543334, L543333,m199
 What's all this for?, We have a new directive. I'm taking over., L543336, L543335,m199
 We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time., Washington thinks it's too late for that., L543338, L543337,m199
 I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you., You're not hearing me., L543340, L543339,m199
" You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.", We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear., L543342, L543341,m199
 That's the chance we have to take.," No, we don't.", L543344, L543343,m199
 Then you're going to have to do it without me.," You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.", L543346, L543345,m199
 No deal., I'm afraid we can't let you go., L543413, L543412,m199
" George... Do you hear me, George?", What?, L543431, L543430,m199
 I just retired., Shermin!! Shermin!!!, L543433, L543432,m199

" You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.", No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride., L543211, L543210,m199
 Is the man who kidnapped you there now?, I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home., L543214, L543213,m199

 I want to try it., This stuff could kill...  Be my guest., L542863, L542862,m199
 What's the matter?, Shit!, L542867, L542866,m199
 Horses., Horses., L542876, L542875,m199
 What?, Music., L542878, L542877,m199
 That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!, It was yellow., L542905, L542904,m199
 I will see it next time., You better., L542908, L542907,m199
 Why are you going here? What is here?, My...  ...car will take me...  ...up there... home., L542910, L542909,m199
 When do you have to be here?, I do not understand., L542912, L542911,m199
 Sun..., Yes., L542915, L542914,m199
 Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?, Yes. Day... night., L542917, L542916,m199
 How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?, Three nights... two days., L542919, L542918,m199
 That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't..., I need you., L542921, L542920,m199
 I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep..., No., L542923, L542922,m199
 You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?, No., L542925, L542924,m199
 Then let me go. You don't need me., No., L542927, L542926,m199
 Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go., When we get here., L542930, L542929,m199
 The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells..., Is that a baby?, L542958, L542957,m199
 Yes., A baby is a new person?, L542960, L542959,m199
 Eh... yes..., Do you have a baby?, L542962, L542961,m199
 No... The closest..., Why?, L542964, L542963,m199
 I'd love to have a baby. But I can't..., Why?, L542966, L542965,m199
 But I must go here., I know that. But the buses don't go there., L542969, L542968,m199
 What is hitchhike?," That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'", L542971, L542970,m199
 Say it.," 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'", L542973, L542972,m199
 The driver will..., But I speak English., L542975, L542974,m199
" Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.", I do not speak English., L542977, L542976,m199
" Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'..."," 'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?", L542979, L542978,m199
 You want this ticket?, Yes., L542981, L542980,m199
" 'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.'"," You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike...  You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this...", L542986, L542985,m199
 Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride., The car will stop?, L542988, L542987,m199
 When do I get to Lathrop Wells?, Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and..., L542991, L542990,m199
 Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it., Can I have the gun?, L542994, L542993,m199
 Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay., Yes., L542998, L542997,m199
 Well... I'm going to go now., Go?, L543000, L542999,m199
 Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye., Goodbye., L543002, L543001,m199
 Jennyhaydn., Yes?, L543004, L543003,m199
 Goodbye., What?, L543010, L543009,m199
 What happened?, I was afraid., L543015, L543014,m199
 Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?, It was a mistake., L543041, L543040,m199
 You thought we were a different planet?!, No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and..., L543043, L543042,m199
" Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'"," We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.", L543045, L543044,m199
 You did? That's funny. So did we., Yes?, L543047, L543046,m199
 Yes.," We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...", L543049, L543048,m199
 The captain..., The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed., L543051, L543050,m199
" Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?", I don't understand 'friend.', L543053, L543052,m199
 A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with..., He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship., L543055, L543054,m199
" The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.", I understand., L543057, L543056,m199
 Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home., What is hell?, L543059, L543058,m199
 It's bad., He will., L543061, L543060,m199
 What are you doing?, Are you my friend?, L543063, L543062,m199
 Yes., I am your friend., L543065, L543064,m199
 Nobody knows., Why?, L543069, L543068,m199
 I like this music., I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?, L543072, L543071,m199
 Do you have music up there?, Yes., L543075, L543074,m199
 I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?, I do not want to., L543077, L543076,m199
 I am not a good singer., That was beautiful., L543081, L543080,m199
 You liked my singing?, Yes. Sing some more., L543083, L543082,m199
 Put that back., But I have never seen this before. I am not complete., L543097, L543096,m199
 You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you., On the radio they say it's good., L543106, L543105,m199
 The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?, No. Get in., L543109, L543108,m199
 You can have one., I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer., L543111, L543110,m199
 Are you angry at me?, No. I'm just not tired. Let's go., L543113, L543112,m199
 I told you goodbye. Why are you here?, The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back., L543267, L543266,m199
 This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back., The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on., L543269, L543268,m199
" If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me."," Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.", L543271, L543270,m199
 I will go. But not you.," You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.", L543273, L543272,m199
 I don't want you to be hurt., Come on., L543275, L543274,m199
 Where are you going?, I must meet my ship., L543282, L543281,m199
 Why can't we wait here for a ride?, I feel better if I move., L543284, L543283,m199
 Asshole!!, Where did you learn that?, L543288, L543287,m199
 We're not going to get a ride tonight., I can't stay on this planet., L543291, L543290,m199
 No one's traveling in this weather., You promised you would get me to my ship., L543293, L543292,m199
 I will. I will. We still have another day., You promised., L543295, L543294,m199
 What are you saying?, You can stop. I will go on alone., L543298, L543297,m199
 Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?, I used the last one to jump off the cliff..., L543302, L543301,m199
 Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.," I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.", L543304, L543303,m199
 You are cold., You're damn right I am., L543308, L543307,m199
 What?, Nothing., L543314, L543313,m199
 Good morning., Horses., L543316, L543315,m199
" You don't forget anything, do you?", No., L543318, L543317,m199
 Hello... hello. How are you this morning?, Do they talk?!, L543320, L543319,m199
" No, they don't talk... We talk to them.", I understand., L543322, L543321,m199
" Oh, you're pretty...", I gave you a baby last night., L543324, L543323,m199
 They are beautiful.," Yes, they are.", L543326, L543325,m199
" You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.", But..., L543328, L543327,m199
 It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have., I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby., L543330, L543329,m199
 The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling., You don't make money gambling. You lose it., L543350, L543349,m199
" May I have twenty-five cents, please?", What for?, L543354, L543353,m199
" Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.", I understand.  Thank you., L543357, L543356,m199
 This is crazy. We don't have time for this., I know how to gamble now., L543359, L543358,m199
 You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship., I want to get money for you and the baby., L543361, L543360,m199
 I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.," Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.", L543363, L543362,m199
 The cook again?, Yes., L543365, L543364,m199
 It'll tell you pretty much everything about us..., This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this., L543368, L543367,m199
 Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary., I understand., L543370, L543369,m199
" It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything."," Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.", L543372, L543371,m199
 What will you say about us?, I will say that we can be friends., L543374, L543373,m199
 This is yours...," If you want to keep it, you can.", L543377, L543376,m199
 Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?, You want the baby to laugh at me., L543380, L543379,m199
 How long will it take you to get home?," Many, many days and nights...", L543383, L543382,m199
 I'm sure we could find a country and western station.," No, thank you.", L543386, L543385,m199
 There., Where?, L543390, L543389,m199
 The yellow one.," Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.", L543392, L543391,m199
 Where do you think you're going?," Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.", L543416, L543415,m199
 Well..., I must go., L543438, L543437,m199
 What do I do now?, You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.', L543440, L543439,m199
 I love you.," I'm never going to see you again, am I?", L543442, L543441,m199
 Tell the baby about me., I will., L543446, L543445,m199
 Help me!!, You could have killed us both!!, L542694, L542693,m199
 Jesus Christ!! You crazy people..., Call the police!!, L542697, L542696,m199
 Help me!!!," Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.", L542700, L542699,m199
" Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...", He doesn't understand... just walk away..., L542702, L542701,m199
 You sure this is your car?, My grandmother's rich., L543230, L543229,m199
" Slow down, slow down."," Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.", L543232, L543231,m199
 I told you I'm looking for someone.," In the cars, too?!", L543234, L543233,m199
 I don't know where he is., This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast., L543236, L543235,m199
 They after you?," What? No, of course not.", L543238, L543237,m199
" I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all."," If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?", L543255, L543254,m199
 The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way., Pull over. I've got to get back there., L543258, L543257,m199
 Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody., It's easier not to tell if you don't know., L543260, L543259,m199
 Wait. Could I have your autograph?, Sure., L543262, L543261,m199
 I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you., Don't worry. I'll be all right., L543264, L543263,m199
 Is it for real?, Get Fox., L542580, L542579,m199
 Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow., I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow., L542602, L542601,m199
" This is crazy. What were we going to do if that had been the ship? We have two thirty calibre machine guns, three M16's and some handguns."," Give it a rest, Lyman.", L542609, L542608,m199
" That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you."," Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?", L542612, L542611,m199

 I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop Wells and put him on the bus. He didn't stay on though and they drove off together., Doesn't make sense., L543038, L543037,m199
 Tell him I'm not here., I did., L543130, L543129,m199
" You get that, Lyman?", We're ready., L543249, L543248,m199
 I'm telling you they're probably friendly., Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say..., L542604, L542603,m199
 They're gonna let some local cop blow him away., Save us all a lot of trouble., L542891, L542890,m199
" Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.", Bullshit!, L542893, L542892,m199
" You have no conception of this, do you?"," You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?", L542895, L542894,m199
 This has always been my favorite time of day., Very beautiful country up here..., L542557, L542556,m199
" Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?", Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going., L542559, L542558,m199
 Can you see under the faceplate?, No., L542561, L542560,m199
 There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then..., Wait'll you see it., L542563, L542562,m199
 We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared., Was there visual contact?, L542565, L542564,m199
" No, sir. Radar.", It could have been anything., L542567, L542566,m199

" Oh, Jesus.", We better get it into the box. Come on..., L542573, L542572,m199
 There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident., It was only an accident that we discovered them., L542709, L542708,m199
" You married, Major?", Twenty-eight years., L542712, L542711,m199
 To the same woman?, Yes., L542714, L542713,m199
 How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?," It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?", L542717, L542716,m199
 Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'..., It was a man though... right?, L542719, L542718,m199
" Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.", It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman., L542723, L542722,m199

 I told you...," Judy, that's stupid.", L542730, L542729,m199
" Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat.

 I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times., Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral., L542734, L542733,m199

" Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.", You saw that?, L543031, L543030,m199
" Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?", I wouldn't think so., L543034, L543033,m199
" That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.", We will.  Something's wrong here. She's helping him now., L543036, L543035,m199

" Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.

" Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.

 You said you were going to get her out of this.," Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  ""Stand by your man"". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.", L551060, L551059,m200
 He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone., I'd love to.  But he keeps showing up.  And you keep talking to him.  I can't have that--, L551062, L551061,m200

" Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself."," It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.", L550955, L550954,m200
" That's a good one, coming from you."," Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.", L550957, L550956,m200
 He has his uses too., What?  He gonna record you on his label?, L550959, L550958,m200

" Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.", Can't do it., L550968, L550967,m200
" You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.", Iris is dead.  She was murdered., L551042, L551041,m200
 Who did it?," Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.

 What's going on?," Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.", L551282, L551281,m200
 How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?, We should talk alone., L551285, L551284,m200
 So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do., Yeah... he figured out what to do all right., L551297, L551296,m200
 You think Tran killed her?, The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there., L551299, L551298,m200

 Sounds good.," I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.

It's all doable.", L550765, L550764,m200
" Talk to me about costs, here."," Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.", L550767, L550766,m200
 What?  Right Here?, Step into my office., L550769, L550768,m200
" Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?"," You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--", L550773, L550772,m200
 You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders., Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money., L550779, L550778,m200

 Naw.  She won't call me.," Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.", L550795, L550794,m200
" I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes."," Hey, Iris, you okay?", L550798, L550797,m200
" See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense."," Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.", L550817, L550816,m200
" I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--", Shutup a second!, L550826, L550825,m200
" Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy."," I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.", L550972, L550971,m200
 You should feel like shit.," I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?", L550974, L550973,m200
" Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.", I'm on her., L550976, L550975,m200

" Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?", He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her..., L551017, L551016,m200
 And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again., He records himself raping and killing her--, L551019, L551018,m200
 But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--," So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.", L551021, L551020,m200
 So've I.  Too much., But this is a bad one., L551023, L551022,m200
 Top ten.," He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.", L551025, L551024,m200
 That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy., Why me?, L551029, L551028,m200
" Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed."," W'sup, Max?", L551112, L551111,m200
 Faith OK?, Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash., L551115, L551114,m200
 Looks like she was holding out.," Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.", L551117, L551116,m200
 He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.," I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.", L551119, L551118,m200
 Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.," You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!", L551248, L551247,m200
 He's been cooked-off, Is he dead?, L551251, L551250,m200
 Whattya mean?, All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff., L551259, L551258,m200
 What stuff?," Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.", L551261, L551260,m200
 Jesus.," Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.", L551263, L551262,m200
" Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.", Okay... what about Strickland?, L551268, L551267,m200
" He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade.", What do you mean?, L551316, L551315,m200
 Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.," This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?", L551318, L551317,m200
 2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her., I intend to., L551321, L551320,m200
" No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.", Only way I could stand your ties., L551392, L551391,m200
 I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice., Where's Faith?, L551394, L551393,m200
 I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran., What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?, L551396, L551395,m200
 You just did., Jesus!, L551398, L551397,m200
" So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.", That's pretty much the way it happened., L551401, L551400,m200
" Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?", That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy., L551403, L551402,m200
 Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?, You bet.  Did you like it?, L551405, L551404,m200
 Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect., I won't say anything., L551408, L551407,m200
" Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times."," And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.", L551411, L551410,m200
" No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway."," You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.", L551413, L551412,m200
 So there never was a death squad., Naawww., L551417, L551416,m200
 Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.," Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that.  Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  You gotta take what you can, while you can.  Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.", L551419, L551418,m200
 How did you hook up with Faith?," This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...", L551421, L551420,m200
" Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny."," Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.", L550671, L550670,m200
 How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?, With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig., L550674, L550673,m200
" Yeah, but how'd it get to you?"," I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?", L550676, L550675,m200
" Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.", Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black., L550678, L550677,m200
 I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.," Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.", L550680, L550679,m200
 So lay it off to somebody else.," Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it...", L550682, L550681,m200
" Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'."," Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.", L550684, L550683,m200
" Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'."," Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'", L550687, L550686,m200
" I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.", Ha!  That's for fucking sure., L550689, L550688,m200
 Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.," Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.", L551142, L551141,m200
" Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...", What?, L551147, L551146,m200
" Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.", Who was just here?, L551149, L551148,m200
" Iris, man.  Pay attention."," Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!", L551151, L551150,m200
" Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.", What clip?  What was it?, L551153, L551152,m200
" I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'", She never gave me a tape., L551155, L551154,m200
" You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?"," You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.", L550917, L550916,m200
" Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist."," Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.", L550922, L550921,m200
 I always do.," Faith, can I talk to you a second?", L550924, L550923,m200
 About what?," That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?", L550928, L550927,m200
 Charm.," Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?", L551053, L551052,m200
 It's alright.  He means it., I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?, L551055, L551054,m200

 Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?," I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.", L550870, L550869,m200
" I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?", Your sex life?, L550872, L550871,m200
" Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story."," They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?", L550820, L550819,m200
" Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--"," Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.", L550834, L550833,m200

 Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--, Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?, L550838, L550837,m200
" Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight."," Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.", L550840, L550839,m200
" Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.", Mace!  You're a life-saver., L550842, L550841,m200

" Uh huh, I wanna hear this part."," Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.

 Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.," Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.

 I thought we were friends.," No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.

 She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this., She's my destiny., L550913, L550912,m200
 Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride., You'll see., L550915, L550914,m200
" You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you.

 What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.," It is my sword and my shield, Macey.", L550993, L550992,m200
 What's that?  Present from Faith?, No idea., L550995, L550994,m200
 What is it?, Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!, L551000, L550999,m200
" My God, Lenny.  What is it?", Black.  Jack., L551005, L551004,m200
 Blackjack?  I don't understand--," Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.", L551007, L551006,m200
 And gives it to you., Wants to share., L551027, L551026,m200

" Jesus, Mace.  Back off."," This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.", L551035, L551034,m200
 Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me., So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--, L551039, L551038,m200
 Is this great fabric or what?, You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?, L551072, L551071,m200

 Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.," I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong...", L551079, L551078,m200
" No more, Lenny.", Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad., L551081, L551080,m200
" She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.", It's not your fault., L551083, L551082,m200

 No it doesn't., Because Iris knew somebody was after her., L551089, L551088,m200
" She said ""If they get me"".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.", So the guy's not a sicko., L551091, L551090,m200
" If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko."," Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?", L551093, L551092,m200
 Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?, That's where it gets a little strange., L551095, L551094,m200
 And what about the guy that was following me?, Now you're really getting paranoid., L551097, L551096,m200
" The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck?", Sure., L551099, L551098,m200
 How's Zander?, OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him., L551101, L551100,m200
" I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.", S'okay.  I know you still love me., L551103, L551102,m200
 Whatup Lenny?," Jesus, Mace!", L551121, L551120,m200
 Where we going?, Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car., L551123, L551122,m200
 What is it?, This tie doesn't go with blue!, L551126, L551125,m200
 Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.," Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!", L551129, L551128,m200
 You better keep a low profile for a while., No shit.  You got someplace in mind?, L551131, L551130,m200
" Lenny, have you lost it completely?"," Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  ""A Love Supreme."" Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.", L551135, L551134,m200
 Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.," She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...", L551157, L551156,m200
" Lenny, give them the tape.", It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case..., L551166, L551165,m200
 Shit!, Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant., L551172, L551171,m200
 Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?, Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do., L551174, L551173,m200
 Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!," It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.", L551176, L551175,m200
 This is bad., The gas tank's going to go any second!, L551178, L551177,m200
 Are you out of your fucking mind?!," Fire's out, isn't it?", L551180, L551179,m200
 I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.," Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.", L551186, L551185,m200
 Those two guys were cops., You sure?, L551191, L551190,m200
 Tell me., I can't tell you.  You've got to see., L551201, L551200,m200
 Uh unh.  I won't do it., Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important., L551203, L551202,m200
" Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?", I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all., L551225, L551224,m200
 We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance., You know what this tape could do if it gets out., L551229, L551228,m200
" I've got a good idea, yeah.", People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see., L551231, L551230,m200
" So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny."," Well, look at the plus side.", L551239, L551238,m200
 There's a plus side?, Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you., L551241, L551240,m200
 It was a tough call., I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops., L551243, L551242,m200
 I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her., Why?, L551245, L551244,m200
 He's totally cut off from the outer world., How long does it last?  Oh., L551254, L551253,m200
" The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow..."," Yeah, right, blow it open.", L551266, L551265,m200
 Who's Strickland?, Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him., L551271, L551270,m200
 Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch., Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way., L551294, L551293,m200
" Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--", I'm not going., L551323, L551322,m200
 Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--," Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.", L551325, L551324,m200
 Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.," It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...", L551333, L551332,m200
 I guess., And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?, L551335, L551334,m200
" I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.", You never told me., L551338, L551337,m200
" But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left."," No, it's not.", L551340, L551339,m200
 Mace... you're a girl.," Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.", L551344, L551343,m200
 Got your ticket?, No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake., L551346, L551345,m200
 You see Tran?, Uh unh., L551348, L551347,m200
 Alright.  We're going up., And do what?  Take on his whole posse?, L551351, L551350,m200
 That's the original.  There are no copies., Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal., L551354, L551353,m200
 Take it to him., A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!, L551359, L551358,m200
 Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?, Then we'll be right where we are now., L551362, L551361,m200
 Are we under arrest?, Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours., L551443, L551442,m200
" Hey, Lenny.  We made it.", Yeah.  We did., L551448, L551447,m200
 Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding., See you downtown., L551450, L551449,m200
 Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a guy?, Just Lenny., L551105, L551104,m200
 Right.  That explains it., Are you going to make me beg?, L551107, L551106,m200
 What is that?, Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good., L551109, L551108,m200
" We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop."," Aw, Mom!", L551195, L551194,m200
" No.  I haven't noticed because I make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?"," Sucks.  Hey, Bobby, turn that up.", L550822, L550821,m200
" Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?"," Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.", L550828, L550827,m200
 But I mean isn't he Faith's new-- , Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him., L550830, L550829,m200
" He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing you to do something."," Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.  It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?", L551033, L551032,m200
" Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.", Take the tape to the cops., L551037, L551036,m200
 Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks., This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys., L551256, L551255,m200
 So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!, Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it., L551274, L551273,m200
" Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!", You really want that on your head?, L551276, L551275,m200
 Was this him?, Um... he was older., L562599, L562598,m201
 Besides that.," To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.", L562601, L562600,m201
 Testa?," The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.", L562603, L562602,m201
 Have you had a chance to think about --," Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter ""Z,"" turned it on it's side, got ""N"" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?", L562497, L562496,m201
 No.," Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...", L562499, L562498,m201
" ...well, there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work, educate the public, but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle. You know when they say, stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.", Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials., L562501, L562500,m201
 Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?, Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low., L562506, L562505,m201

 Where's the Nuevo American Diner?, Ten miles back on the Texas side., L562243, L562242,m201

 You tell me.," No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?", L562376, L562375,m201

" Ripped off. By hand, my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time, there's blood on his throat."," That's the thing. Don't know if it connects, but Harold here had a thing about eyes. Two of the victims had their eyes gouged out, another punctured. Took polaroids after.", L562313, L562312,m201
 There seems to be a discrepancy.," Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.", L562874, L562873,m201
 I have 6 tons.," Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.", L562876, L562875,m201

" Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.", What about his killer?, L562309, L562308,m201
" Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.", What's with the eyelids?, L562311, L562310,m201

" Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about ""Zorro Killer"" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?", Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck., L562415, L562414,m201
" Chuck, hello.  This is Agent Kulok. She has a background in medical forensics.", Just an observer., L562304, L562303,m201
" We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?", Maybe cause he's smart., L562344, L562343,m201

" Deputy Director, get out, sir.", What are you doing?, L562947, L562946,m201

 I'll relay this to CIIAC., They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --, L562361, L562360,m201
" I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.", I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it., L562363, L562362,m201
 The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.," Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.", L562365, L562364,m201
 You refused to comply with a direct order.," I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.", L562367, L562366,m201

" How do you feel, Agent"," Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.", L562401, L562400,m201
 Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard., He got away. I had him. He got away., L562403, L562402,m201
 Do you think he singled you out?," No, just coincidence. He knew who I was, of course. He had my ID -- did he keep it?", L562405, L562404,m201
 The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?, Go ahead., L562410, L562409,m201
" Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms."," This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.", L562422, L562421,m201
 You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?," If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?", L562424, L562423,m201
 I'll take it into consideration., What I do requires confidentiality., L562426, L562425,m201
" I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?", They like my stories. They like the way I think. They're into fantasy. I turn them on., L562428, L562427,m201
" You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?"," Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.", L562546, L562545,m201

" ""Murman"" was the alter identity of William Heirens, the original ""Catch Me Before I Kill Again"" killer. Short for ""Murder Man."" It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field.", I spoke with Lloyd Daitz., L562580, L562579,m201
" That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met."," ""Was?""", L562582, L562581,m201
" We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero."," You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.", L562584, L562583,m201

" Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close."," You knew the arm slash was not ""Zorro.""", L562588, L562587,m201
" I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.", What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?, L562590, L562589,m201

 Why did you go to Chicago?, I was visiting an old college friend., L562736, L562735,m201
 You didn't tell anyone where you were?," An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.", L562738, L562737,m201

 He's got you believing in Zero now too., I need to get to Amarillo immediately., L562896, L562895,m201
 Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?, I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days., L562898, L562897,m201
" We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him."," What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?", L562900, L562899,m201
" Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.", There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now., L562902, L562901,m201
 Dick Low's a killer too., You're as crazy as he is! He's right! You don't give a damn about saving lives at all! Fuck you!, L562904, L562903,m201

 Why did he come out here? What's going on?," Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics.  What did you do to piss him off?", L562329, L562328,m201
 This is a sexy case.," Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border.

 Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge., The man knew how to dress., L562437, L562436,m201
 Don't even go there. What's up?," Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes ""ghosted,"" invisible.", L562439, L562438,m201
 What about the chat rooms themselves?," That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service.

 There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is., That's true., L562648, L562647,m201
 Then there's the other issue., What's that?, L562650, L562649,m201
" You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.", I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out., L562652, L562651,m201
 And nobody else can do that?, Not the way I can., L562654, L562653,m201
" That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.", Don't confuse what we do with who we are., L562656, L562655,m201
 Hello?, Jaime? Where are you?, L562693, L562692,m201
 Where are you? Everybody's looking for you., What's up?, L562695, L562694,m201
 My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago., You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you., L562710, L562709,m201
 Start killing people for real?, Suspect Zero., L562712, L562711,m201
 That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.," But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low.", L562714, L562713,m201
 This feels like something out of a spy novel., I guess I'm a little paranoid., L562814, L562813,m201
" I met with Richard Low.  These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on."," Slow down a second, you met with Low --", L562817, L562816,m201
 You were right. He found me., And you're working with him?, L562819, L562818,m201
 I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory., Does one exist?, L562821, L562820,m201
" Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.", Koessler doesn't know any of this?, L562823, L562822,m201
 I'd be real careful if I were you.," It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.", L562826, L562825,m201
" It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong."," They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.", L562828, L562827,m201
 You're putting me in a difficult position.," I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry, I've cleared it.", L562830, L562829,m201
" Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?"," Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.", L562832, L562831,m201
 But why this pattern?," Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.", L562848, L562847,m201
" Tom, you okay?", Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that., L562850, L562849,m201
 You okay?," Yeah, of course.", L562852, L562851,m201
 It's quite advanced.," Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as ""burn residue."" Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.", L562857, L562856,m201
 All the same killer?, Low calls him Suspect Zero., L562859, L562858,m201
 Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so., That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low., L562861, L562860,m201
" You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going."," But it was your idea: ""use Zero,"" you said, use Zero to get Low.", L562863, L562862,m201
 I haven't changed anything.  Damn., I..., L562866, L562865,m201
 Jaime --, It's a truck. A refrigerated truck., L562869, L562868,m201
" Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.", How are we going to find him?, L562871, L562870,m201
 What happened?, I'm going to Amarillo., L562907, L562906,m201
 Agent..., Kulok., L562930, L562929,m201
 Unlock these cuffs., Sit back., L562955, L562954,m201
 Mack must think Zero has a police band.," Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me.  Unhook me.", L562961, L562960,m201
 Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?, I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you., L562963, L562962,m201
" Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.", No weapon., L562982, L562981,m201
" Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need me.", I'll be back., L562986, L562985,m201
 How did you know Speck was a killer?, The little piggie speaks., L562396, L562395,m201
 Who are you?," I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.", L562398, L562397,m201
 Agent Mackelway?, Yes., L562749, L562748,m201
 This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.," Yes, sir.", L562751, L562750,m201
 Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.," I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.", L562760, L562759,m201
 How's the arm?," I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.", L562762, L562761,m201
 He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?, He's moved on to TV., L562764, L562763,m201
" What was your weakness, sir?"," I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.", L562767, L562766,m201
 Suspect Zero?," Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.", L562769, L562768,m201
 So you went underground?," Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through.  Where's the file?", L562771, L562770,m201
 I don't carry it with me., You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says., L562773, L562772,m201
 Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.," The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.", L562776, L562775,m201
" It's my master list of missing persons: men, boys, girls, children over the last ten years. Two hundred and eighty-five names. A pool of possible victims.", Zero killed them all?, L562779, L562778,m201
" Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?", Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms., L562781, L562780,m201
" After my hiatus, after I got my priorities readjusted, I drifted online, started tracking porn chat rooms, looking for Zero. Got accepted, came across these boys swapping stories, pictures, downloads. Never found Zero, but I did come across some Class A scumbags.", How do you know who's real and who's not?, L562783, L562782,m201
" And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.", You knew it was me all along?, L562785, L562784,m201
" There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.", I already have an employer., L562788, L562787,m201
" If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.", Who told you about her?, L562790, L562789,m201
" You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.", It was the mall., L562792, L562791,m201
" I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --", Those were just fantasies., L562794, L562793,m201
 We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone., Maybe you should back off., L562796, L562795,m201
" This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.", You? You went by the book?, L562798, L562797,m201
 Is he dead?, Yeah., L562991, L562990,m201
 Was it Zero?, Yeah., L562994, L562993,m201
" [Fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.]", Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel., L562478, L562477,m201
 [Reality very risky.], Whatever happened to MyDick?, L562532, L562531,m201
" [Lionheart, what happened?]"," Something came up, Murman, my man.", L562659, L562658,m201
" [You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]"," Lead the way, Murman.", L562666, L562665,m201
 I've been to Chicago.," [Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]", L562670, L562669,m201
" If I owe, I will go.", [The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?], L562672, L562671,m201
" Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try."," [Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]", L562674, L562673,m201
" [If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]"," Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.", L562717, L562716,m201
 Let's talk about Zero.," [Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]", L562722, L562721,m201
 I want to help you.," [Not the heart, the watch.]", L562724, L562723,m201
 I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation., [Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.], L562726, L562725,m201
 Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?, [You tell me.], L562728, L562727,m201
 George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler., [What does the file say?], L562730, L562729,m201
 I want to go live with you., [And I want to go back to Needlepoint.], L562732, L562731,m201
" Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.", [I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.], L562734, L562733,m201
" Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.", So you're the new meat?, L562202, L562201,m201
" Yes, sir.", What did you do to end up here?, L562204, L562203,m201
" I believe it's in my file, sir."," Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?", L562206, L562205,m201
 Thomas Mackelway.," Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?", L562208, L562207,m201
" Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.", Sounds like fun., L562210, L562209,m201
" ""Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center."" Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay, you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here."," I screwed up twice, sir.", L562212, L562211,m201
 I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?," Four hundred and sixty, sir.", L562214, L562213,m201
" ""Attitude Adjustment Issues"" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?", I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request., L562216, L562215,m201
" This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket."," I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.", L562218, L562217,m201
" Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?"," Yes, sir.", L562223, L562222,m201
 Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon., This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out., L562264, L562263,m201
 Koessler?, The same., L562266, L562265,m201
 No.," Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.", L562302, L562301,m201
" ""MyDick?""", MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name., L562355, L562354,m201
 I don't...," Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the ""item"" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.", L562357, L562356,m201
 Speck is dead., I talked to him., L562359, L562358,m201
 But why attack an Agent?," He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.", L562420, L562419,m201
 How far is Amarillo?, 350 miles., L562883, L562882,m201
" Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo."," Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?", L562886, L562885,m201
 I don't think you understand.," What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?", L562892, L562891,m201
 Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low., Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway., L562894, L562893,m201
" I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.", Murman!, L562970, L562969,m201
 He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.," Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it, how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms, swapped goodies: pictures, panties, jewelry, body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls, oh yeah, harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us.", L562972, L562971,m201
" You want to ""profile"" me? Find out what makes me ""tick""? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname?", It's over for you., L562977, L562976,m201
" You should see it, Professor Barnhardt! You should go out and see it for yourself!", Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here., L591882, L591881,m211
 The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!, What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it., L591884, L591883,m211
 What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?, I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting., L591886, L591885,m211
 Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?, He'll be there at 8:30., L591888, L591887,m211
" Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?"," Yes, sir -- it certainly does!", L591890, L591889,m211
 You wrote this?, It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time., L591722, L591721,m211
 Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?," Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.", L591726, L591725,m211
 How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?, I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship., L591728, L591727,m211
" As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have."," My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.", L591730, L591729,m211
" You have faith, Professor Barnhardt"," It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.", L591733, L591732,m211
 I would like to explain something of my mission here., That was my first question., L591735, L591734,m211
 It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets., Yes -- that is true., L591737, L591736,m211
" In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.", If you mean that you are afraid of us--, L591739, L591738,m211
" We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.", These other planets -- do they have peace and security?, L591741, L591740,m211
" We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos."," We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?", L591743, L591742,m211
" I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.", Would you care to be more specific?, L591745, L591744,m211
 I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful., I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?, L591748, L591747,m211
 What -- what sort of action do you mean?," Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.  Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.", L591750, L591749,m211
" Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.", That's what I came to see you about., L591752, L591751,m211
 It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world., I leave that in your hands., L591754, L591753,m211
 You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?, No -- not at all., L591756, L591755,m211
 What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?, My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house., L591758, L591757,m211
 I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy., I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting., L591760, L591759,m211
" One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?"," I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.", L591762, L591761,m211
 Such power exists?, I assure you such power exists., L591764, L591763,m211
 The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--, Yes., L591766, L591765,m211
" Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?", Yes -- of course., L591768, L591767,m211
 Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet., That can easily be arranged., L591770, L591769,m211
 I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything., Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something., L591772, L591771,m211
 Maybe a little demonstration., Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?, L591774, L591773,m211
" Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man."," I think we've all been hearing too much about ""space men.""", L591524, L591523,m211
" Can I help you look for the space man? Can I?  I know what he looks like! He's got a square head -- and, three great big eyes!"," That's enough, Bobby. I think it's time you went to bed.", L591528, L591527,m211
 Hi Mom!," Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.", L591663, L591662,m211
" Did you have a nice day, dear?"," Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?", L591667, L591666,m211
" Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.", Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?, L591677, L591676,m211
 We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--, Professor Barnhardt., L591680, L591679,m211
" Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?"," Of course, dear.", L591682, L591681,m211
" Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.", Okay., L591807, L591806,m211
 Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter," Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.", L591809, L591808,m211
 Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?, Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic., L591811, L591810,m211
 Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?," What do you mean, dear?", L591813, L591812,m211
" I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?"," No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night, darling.", L591815, L591814,m211
 Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?," I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!", L591823, L591822,m211
 Tell me what?," I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!", L591825, L591824,m211
" Now, Bobby, just a minute--"," Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!", L591827, L591826,m211
" Bobby, you've been dreaming again."," No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!", L591829, L591828,m211
" Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house."," Yes, I have!", L591836, L591835,m211
 He gave these to you?," Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.", L591844, L591843,m211
" Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?"," Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.", L591847, L591846,m211
" Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?"," Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!", L591853, L591852,m211
 Are you an FBI man?, No -- I'm afraid not., L591522, L591521,m211
 Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?," Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.", L591572, L591571,m211
" Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world."," He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?", L591577, L591576,m211
 Sure. Right near where my mother works., Where is that?, L591579, L591578,m211
" Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.", I shouldn't be at all surprised., L591582, L591581,m211
" Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?"," Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.", L591584, L591583,m211
 I thought that was only for bombs.," No. It's for a lot of other things, too.", L591586, L591585,m211
 You think it can go faster than an F- 36?, Yes -- I think so., L591588, L591587,m211
 Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster., Gee! How could they make a landing?, L591591, L591590,m211
 You think they'll ever find him?," I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.", L591595, L591594,m211
 Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?, Velocity is the time rate of change of position., L591597, L591596,m211
 Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.," You're just kidding, aren't you?", L591600, L591599,m211
 Wouldn't you like to meet him?," Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.", L591602, L591601,m211
 What does that mean?, It's a problem in celestial mechanics., L591608, L591607,m211
 Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer., He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way., L591610, L591609,m211
 Did all these people die in wars?, Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?, L591625, L591624,m211
 No -- I'm afraid not.," Mr. Carpenter"" -- you don't seem to know about anything.", L591627, L591626,m211
" I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.", Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?, L591629, L591628,m211
 Go to the movies., All right., L591634, L591633,m211
 No foolin'? Will you?," Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?", L591636, L591635,m211
 I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars., No -- I want to take you to the movies.  Do you think they'd accept these?, L591638, L591637,m211
 Gee -- those look like diamonds!, Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out., L591640, L591639,m211
 Bet they're worth about a million dollars., Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?, L591642, L591641,m211
" Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter."," Why not, Bobby?", L591646, L591645,m211
 Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady., Mr. Brady's a cop., L591665, L591664,m211
 We certainly did., We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--, L591669, L591668,m211
" Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story."," We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.", L591674, L591673,m211
" All you have to remember is, first find the common denominator -- then subtract."," Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.", L591802, L591801,m211
 Bobby -- have you a flashlight?, Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight., L591818, L591817,m211
" What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?"," Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.", L591820, L591819,m211
" The skeletal structure is completely normal.  Same for the major organs -û heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.", And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?, L591484, L591483,m211
" Oh, I'd say forty-five.", He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight., L591486, L591485,m211
 I don't believe it., Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty., L591488, L591487,m211
 How does he explain that?, He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor., L591490, L591489,m211
 My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu., Just Klaatu., L591435, L591434,m211
 The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--," Sit down, Mr. Harley.", L591437, L591436,m211
 I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.  Had you been traveling long?, About five months -- your months., L591439, L591438,m211
 You must have come a long way., About 250 million of your miles., L591441, L591440,m211
 Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from., From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors., L591443, L591442,m211
 It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.," I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.", L591445, L591444,m211
 The present situation?, I mean the reasons for my coming here., L591447, L591446,m211
" We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?"," I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.", L591449, L591448,m211
 Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--," This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.", L591451, L591450,m211
 I -- I'm not sure I understand--, I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth., L591453, L591452,m211
 I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances., I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?, L591455, L591454,m211
 You know about the United Nations?," We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.", L591457, L591456,m211
 You must have a rather strange impression of us., The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle., L591459, L591458,m211
 I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--," I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.", L591461, L591460,m211
 I was only hoping to make you understand., My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth., L591463, L591462,m211
 Perhaps if you could explain a little--," I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?", L591465, L591464,m211
 We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations., Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?, L591467, L591466,m211
 I will make that recommendation to the President.  I must tell you in all honesty that I'm extremely dubious about the results., Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are., L591471, L591470,m211
 Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around., Thank you... Have you any news?, L591501, L591500,m211
 I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust--  Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power--, It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world., L591504, L591503,m211
" Now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President", I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations.  I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions., L591506, L591505,m211
" Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.", I can judge only by what I see., L591508, L591507,m211
 Your impatience is quite understandable., I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it., L591510, L591509,m211
" Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.", Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible., L591513, L591512,m211
" We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.", There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?, L591560, L591559,m211
" Well, we could--"," There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.", L591562, L591561,m211
 It was a wonderful day., You still haven't answered my question., L591656, L591655,m211
" You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over.", The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--, L591658, L591657,m211
 You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it., A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think., L591660, L591659,m211
 Hello--, You ready?, L591789, L591788,m211
 I will be in just a minute., The picture starts at eight-fifty., L591791, L591790,m211
 I was talking to Mr. Carpenter., I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding., L591793, L591792,m211
" Oh, Tom, that was awful."," I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter.  I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all, what do you know about him?", L591799, L591798,m211
 He's not there.  But look what I found in his room, Is it real?, L591840, L591839,m211
 I wonder if we ought to--, Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight., L591849, L591848,m211
 You think it's all right for you to stay here?, I've got a good lock on my door.  And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight., L591851, L591850,m211
 I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.," I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.", L591861, L591860,m211
 Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--, Come on in., L591933, L591932,m211
" I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.", What about him?, L591935, L591934,m211
" Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?"," All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.", L591937, L591936,m211
 How do you know?, Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody., L591939, L591938,m211
 Are you crazy? After what happened today?, You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is., L591941, L591940,m211
 Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.," That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.", L591943, L591942,m211
 He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in., But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for., L591945, L591944,m211
" He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.", Is that what you're thinking about?, L591947, L591946,m211
" Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!", I don't care about the rest of the world!, L591952, L591951,m211
 You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers., I feel different right now., L591954, L591953,m211
 You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!, I'm not going to marry anybody., L591956, L591955,m211
 I don't know how to thank you., I enjoyed every minute of it., L591671, L591670,m211
 Everyone seems so-- , Jittery is the word., L591780, L591779,m211
 Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery., He has his homework to keep him occupied., L591782, L591781,m211
" He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.", Naturally I think so., L591784, L591783,m211
" Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?"," Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.", L591787, L591786,m211
 Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.," Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.", L591795, L591794,m211
" Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight."," Goodnight, my dear.", L591805, L591804,m211
 Oh -- hello--, May I see you for a minute?, L591856, L591855,m211
 I -- I was Just going to lunch., May I walk out with you?, L591858, L591857,m211
 I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--, Yes--?, L591863, L591862,m211
 I want to know what he told you last night., I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination., L591865, L591864,m211
 What is it you want?," Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you--", L591869, L591868,m211
 What happened?, What time is it?, L591871, L591870,m211
 Just twelve., We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes., L591873, L591872,m211
 We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse., It won't work., L591875, L591874,m211
 Why not?, You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world., L591877, L591876,m211
 You hold great hope for this meeting.," I can see no other hope for your planet. If the meeting should fail, then I'm afraid there is no hope.", L591912, L591911,m211
 It must be twelve-thirty., Yes -- Just exactly., L591914, L591913,m211
 Where are you going now?, Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--, L591916, L591915,m211
" No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.", Who?, L591918, L591917,m211
 I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting., Where is the meeting going to be?, L591962, L591961,m211
 It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's., I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me., L591967, L591966,m211
" Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?"," There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: ""Klaatu barada nikto."" Please repeat that.", L591969, L591968,m211
" ""Klaatu barada nikto.""", Remember those words., L591971, L591970,m211
 Hello., I -- I thought you were--, L591980, L591979,m211
 I was., You mean he has the power of life and death?, L591982, L591981,m211
 No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.," This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.", L591984, L591983,m211
 But how -- how long--?, How long will I live?  That no one can say., L591986, L591985,m211
 We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with., He'll have you -- and Tom., L591992, L591991,m211
 No. That's all finished., I'm sorry., L591994, L591993,m211
 How dare you write on that blackboard!  Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?, He'll catch on to it in no time now., L591616, L591615,m211
 How did you get in here? And what do you want?, We came to see Professor Barnhardt., L591618, L591617,m211
" Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.", You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me., L591620, L591619,m211
 Is it worth anything?, I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?, L591902, L591901,m211
 That's what I wanted you to tell me., There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world., L591904, L591903,m211
 You sure about that?, Would you like to sell it?, L591906, L591905,m211
" No -- no, thanks.", I'd give you a very good price., L591908, L591907,m211
" The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.", I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem., L591692, L591691,m211
" Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.", That's right., L591694, L591693,m211
 I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army., In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself., L591696, L591695,m211
 But I suppose you know the answer.," It's really quite simple... The three- body problem, you know.", L591698, L591697,m211
" Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?", No -- I'm afraid not., L591700, L591699,m211
" Well, how do I know who you are?", You don't., L591702, L591701,m211
 Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts., They would have killed this man?, L591707, L591706,m211
" People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.", How long will that take?, L591709, L591708,m211
 May I suggest that you call the Professor?," Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!", L591714, L591713,m211
 Sixteen., And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year..., L601795, L601794,m213
 What do you want from us?, Just listen., L601842, L601841,m213
" Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots."," Screw it, I'm going up anyway.", L601888, L601887,m213
 All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol., Let's load 'em., L602032, L602031,m213
 Maybe dinner., Dogs don't eat each other., L602035, L602034,m213
 Where these tracks headed?, Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean., L602040, L602039,m213
" What do you mean ""got"" to the dog?"," It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.", L601931, L601930,m213
" Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?"," No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.

 It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?, Most things.  We're very high on purpose., L604085, L604084,m214
 It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors..., Or mud carriers., L604087, L604086,m214

 I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like., How do you decide?, L604091, L604090,m214

 I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there., In where?, L583679, L583678,m215
 We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to., That wasn't a fucking restraint., L583682, L583681,m215
 Relax., Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here., L583685, L583684,m215

 We're late., I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have., L583742, L583741,m215
 It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about., They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for., L583745, L583744,m215

So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave."," I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.", L583639, L583638,m215
" The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?", Yeah., L583789, L583788,m215
 But no one knew until after..., After I..., L583792, L583791,m215
 [Beat] You bled to death., What?, L583794, L583793,m215
 Do you really believe me?," I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...", L583797, L583796,m215
 [Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?, Yes., L583799, L583798,m215
 Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do., I know., L583801, L583800,m215
 Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you., If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?, L583803, L583802,m215
 I didn't kill Officer Harrison., I know., L583805, L583804,m215
 How? Did they figure it out after I died?, No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them., L583807, L583806,m215
 I don't believe a thing she just said.," Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?", L583859, L583858,m215
 I have no idea., You think Lorenson kills you?, L583861, L583860,m215
" Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.", Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with., L583863, L583862,m215
 Why?, Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled., L583865, L583864,m215
 How long do we have?, I don't know., L583893, L583892,m215
 What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy., I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say., L583897, L583896,m215
 Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days., You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't., L583899, L583898,m215
 I might not be able to.," It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...", L583901, L583900,m215
" Me, too."," Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.", L583999, L583998,m215
 You're sure?," Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.", L584001, L584000,m215
 They're not here., They're not., L584003, L584002,m215
 What? What are you thinking?, There're no cars on this street., L584008, L584007,m215
 I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?," I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.", L584011, L584010,m215
 Then why isn't there anyone around?, [Beat] I don't know., L584013, L584012,m215
 Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?, It's Sunday., L584018, L584017,m215
 They've got lives to be grateful for.," William, you're not making sense.", L584022, L584021,m215
 That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.," No, he didn't.", L584058, L584057,m215
" If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face."," Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?", L584063, L584062,m215
 Where are we going?, To the hospital., L584065, L584064,m215
 What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?, Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through., L584068, L584067,m215
 Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her., Ok. Ssh. Rest., L584071, L584070,m215
 What?," When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?", L584085, L584084,m215
 You gotta stop thinking like that.," Then, where are you going?", L584088, L584087,m215
 I've been ok., Good. How's your mom?, L584149, L584148,m215
" [Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie.", Ok., L584171, L584170,m215
 I think so., You're bleeding pretty bad there., L584183, L584182,m215
 It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?, I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive., L584185, L584184,m215
 How you doin'?, I'm doing fine., L584194, L584193,m215
" Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?"," It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.", L583834, L583833,m215
 How?, He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him., L583836, L583835,m215
 I don't understand.," I still don't either, even after all these years.", L583838, L583837,m215
 Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.," I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.", L583851, L583850,m215
 And if I didn't want to come?, I guess I'd ask you why., L583704, L583703,m215
 Because I don't think I'm crazy., You're not crazy., L583706, L583705,m215
 You were convicted of the crime.," That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.", L583709, L583708,m215
 You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged., No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind., L583711, L583710,m215
" Why, what would you do?", I could try to...make it stop., L583716, L583715,m215
 No. I don't want it to., So it's helping?, L583718, L583717,m215
 You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.," Believe me, I know.", L583720, L583719,m215
 My God you look exactly like him., I never knew my father. Did you?, L583824, L583823,m215
" Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.", Why?, L583826, L583825,m215
" At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.", You thought my father was crazy?, L583828, L583827,m215
 What case?, I was working with a boy named Eugene., L583831, L583830,m215
 How'd he get it?, [Beat] I don't know., L583841, L583840,m215
 But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was..., I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here., L583843, L583842,m215
" Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?", How do you know about Dr. Becker?, L583845, L583844,m215
" So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.", Why would we do that?, L583849, L583848,m215
" It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?"," [Beat] Yeah, it is.", L583854, L583853,m215
 Exactly., Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out., L583856, L583855,m215
 You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition., I'll die either way., L583903, L583902,m215
 What do you mean?, You have no idea what's going on., L583907, L583906,m215
" No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.", Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place., L583909, L583908,m215
 You don't understand.," Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.", L583912, L583911,m215
 I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?, Come on. Tell me what you do know., L583917, L583916,m215
 [Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.," Well, what time is it?", L583919, L583918,m215
 Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?, It doesn't look all that different., L583923, L583922,m215
 The future doesn't look different?, No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from., L583925, L583924,m215
 What about the world?, I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life., L583927, L583926,m215
 [Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?, Maybe., L583931, L583930,m215
 Why don't you help me?, Because I don't have time., L583934, L583933,m215
 Why not?, I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it., L583936, L583935,m215
 And how do you know that?, Because of the future. I know what's going to happen., L583938, L583937,m215
 How do you know about Eugene?, You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me., L583942, L583941,m215
 Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.," I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.", L583945, L583944,m215
" I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?", How...how do you know?, L584092, L584091,m215
 You told me this was how it happened., I did?, L584094, L584093,m215
 Who...who kills me?," You have nothing to fear, William.", L584097, L584096,m215
" You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you."," Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?", L584105, L584104,m215
 Can I get some paper and something to write with., What for?, L584107, L584106,m215
 I'm not gonna let that happen.," You still don't believe me, do you?", L584109, L584108,m215
 I do believe you...," No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...", L584111, L584110,m215
" William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.", Listen to me. That's all I ask., L584114, L584113,m215
" He's having absence [pronounced ""absance""] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.", Who told you this?, L584116, L584115,m215
" I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.", What are you talking about?, L584119, L584118,m215
 You know how to get there?," Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.", L584141, L584140,m215
" That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know.

 I tried to kill my wife., Don't you go to jail for that?, L583480, L583479,m215
" Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy."," Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.", L583484, L583483,m215
 What were you talking about the other day?, I wasn't talking about anything., L583722, L583721,m215
 I know you need one when it's really cold.," [Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.", L583726, L583725,m215
 Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.," [Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.", L583728, L583727,m215

" Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...", No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days., L583732, L583731,m215
 It's gonna be sticky., Why?, L583737, L583736,m215
 'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!, So what am I supposed to do?, L583739, L583738,m215
" Geez, how's that for a fucking ""thank you""?", Is it true?, L583952, L583951,m215
" MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?"," [Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.", L583957, L583956,m215
 Becker does? Are you sure?, I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this., L583959, L583958,m215
 You ever been to jail?, No., L583777, L583776,m215

 Of course you don't know.," Why ""of course""?", L583546, L583545,m215
" Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple.

 Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?, Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far., L583560, L583559,m215
 Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat., I'll manage., L583562, L583561,m215

 What's this?, The best I could do with what was in your fridge., L583571, L583570,m215

 This is a great song., You remember it?, L583595, L583594,m215
" But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?"," May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire.

" I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.", I'm sorry., L583601, L583600,m215
 Yeah. [Beat] How about you?," Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.", L583603, L583602,m215
 How?," She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.", L583605, L583604,m215

" Well, my boy, you're a hero.", Fuck you., L620997, L620996,m221
" You see, Quaid, none of my people could get close to Kuato.  The fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  So Hauser and I sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.", He's lying.  Hauser turned against you., L621003, L621002,m221
" That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.", Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant., L621005, L621004,m221
 He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall., So why am I still alive?, L621007, L621006,m221
 The guy with the suitcase, Sorry.  Too perfect., L621011, L621010,m221
" Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet."," Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.", L621014, L621013,m221
 The guy's a fucking asshole.," Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes.  And you like Melina, right?  Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right.  She's gonna be Hauser's babe.", L621023, L621022,m221
" Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!"," My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc.", L621035, L621034,m221
 What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.," Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.", L621089, L621088,m221
 Do you expect me to believe you?," Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up...", L621091, L621090,m221
 I didn't want it to end this way.  I wanted Hauser back.  But nooo.  You had to be Quaid., I am Quaid., L621094, L621093,m221
 What the fuck is going on down there?!, I'm trying to neutralize a traitor., L620541, L620540,m221
" If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.", We can't let him run around.  He knows too much., L620543, L620542,m221
 Lori says he can't remember jack shit!," That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.", L620545, L620544,m221
" Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?"," No, sir.", L620668, L620667,m221
" He had help.  From our side, sir.", I know that., L620672, L620671,m221
 But I thought..., Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!, L620674, L620673,m221
" Now let's get down to business.  Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head.  And he might be able to get it, cause they say he's psychic.  Now I have a little plan to keep this from happening.  --Do you think you can play along?"," Yes, sir.", L620677, L620676,m221
 Stop fighting and get out., They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!, L620904, L620903,m221
 Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.," Yes, sir.", L620906, L620905,m221

 I'm with an very important client., Looks like another schizoid embolism., L620411, L620410,m221
 What the fuck is going on here?!  You can't install a simple goddamn double implant?!, It's not my fault.  We hit a memory cap., L620418, L620417,m221
 Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.," Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!", L620427, L620426,m221
 I'm afraid that's not possible., Why not?, L620429, L620428,m221
 Oh shit....Oh shit..., I've been trying to tell you.  Someone erased his memory., L620432, L620431,m221
" Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.", I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there., L620437, L620436,m221
" Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.", Come on...put his head in place., L620439, L620438,m221

 What do you want?," This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.", L620811, L620810,m221
 I'm listening., I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now., L620813, L620812,m221
" Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me."," I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.", L620815, L620814,m221
 Amazing.  Where are we?, At Rekall., L620817, L620816,m221
" You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console."," Oh, I get it", L620819, L620818,m221
 Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.," Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?", L620821, L620820,m221
" I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.", How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?, L620823, L620822,m221
" Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.", Bullshit.  It's all coincidence., L620825, L620824,m221
" What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure", She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall., L620827, L620826,m221
" Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? ""She's real because you dreamed her?""", That's right., L620829, L620828,m221
 You open it., No need to be rude.  I'll do it., L620832, L620831,m221
 Suppose I do...then what?, Swallow this., L620846, L620845,m221

 Sit down., Where's Kuato?, L620943, L620942,m221
 On his way., You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?, L620945, L620944,m221
 Yeah.," Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.", L620947, L620946,m221
" What, aliens?", You tell me., L620949, L620948,m221
 I don't know.," Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.", L620951, L620950,m221
" You're Kuato, right?", Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him., L620953, L620952,m221

 Why not?," A friend of mine tried one of their ""special offers""...Nearly got himself lobotomized.", L620329, L620328,m221
 No shit...," Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it.", L620331, L620330,m221
" Hey, Quaid!", Harry!, L620448, L620447,m221
 What trip?," You went to Rekall, remember?", L620451, L620450,m221
 I did?," Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but you did anyway.", L620453, L620452,m221

 I want that fucker dead., I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady., L620535, L620534,m221

" Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here.  Okay?"," Lori, don't you understand?  I feel I was meant for something more than this.  I want to do something with my life.--I want to be somebody.", L620307, L620306,m221

 Harry from work...He was the boss.," Take it easy.  Tell me exactly what happened?  Why would ""spies"" want to kill you?", L620473, L620472,m221

 Not talk!  I said TALK!!, I'm not your wife., L620495, L620494,m221
 The hell you're not., I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!, L620497, L620496,m221
 You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?, It was implanted by the Agency., L620499, L620498,m221
 And falling in love?, Implanted., L620501, L620500,m221
" Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?", The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up., L620503, L620502,m221
" O.K. then.  If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?", Beats me.  I just work here., L620507, L620506,m221
 But Doug...There's something I want you to know.  You're the best assignment I ever hand.  Really., I'm honored., L620509, L620508,m221

 Right.  Mars., That a problem?, L620347, L620346,m221
" To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.", I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars., L620349, L620348,m221
" Let's see...the basic Mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits.  That's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail.  --A longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant.", What's in the two week package?, L620352, L620351,m221
" First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle", How real does it seem?, L620354, L620353,m221
 As real as any memory in your head.," Come on, don't bullshit me.", L620356, L620355,m221
" I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.", What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?, L620358, L620357,m221
 All right.," Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.", L620362, L620361,m221
 No options., Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?, L620364, L620363,m221
 I give up.," You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an ""Ego Trip"".", L620366, L620365,m221
 I'm not interested in that., You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip., L620368, L620367,m221

 Go on.," I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?", L620374, L620373,m221
 They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!, What's he talking about?, L620420, L620419,m221

" What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?", Hauser left me a note., L620766, L620765,m221
 Hauser?  You're Hauser., Not any more., L620768, L620767,m221
" Hauser, you're lost your mind."," I didn't lose it.  Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  Me.", L620771, L620770,m221
 This is too weird., Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ..., L620773, L620772,m221
 She wasn't really my wife.," Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.", L620776, L620775,m221
 Forget I said wife., No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies., L620778, L620777,m221
 Why would I lie to you?, Because you're still working for Cohaagen., L620780, L620779,m221
 Don't be ridiculous.," You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.", L620782, L620781,m221
 I think you better leave.," Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.", L620785, L620784,m221
 I'm not falling for it., He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good., L620787, L620786,m221
 I said get out!," Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.", L620791, L620790,m221

 Now what?, Jump!, L620875, L620874,m221
 By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?," I used to model for 'em, why?", L620878, L620877,m221

 Like what?, All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me., L620917, L620916,m221
 I don't need Kuato for that.," Oh, since when?", L620919, L620918,m221
 He's lying., You two-faced-bastard., L621000, L620999,m221
 Are you all right?  Are you still you?, I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?, L621046, L621045,m221
 Where are you going?!, The reactor., L621053, L621052,m221
 What reactor?!, The one in the mine!, L621055, L621054,m221
" Where's this ""reactor"" come from?", Aliens built it., L621060, L621059,m221
 You sure about this?, It's just up ahead., L621063, L621062,m221
 Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.," Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.", L621075, L621074,m221
 The whole core of Mars is ice.  The reactor melts it and releases oxygen., Enough for everybody to breathe?, L621079, L621078,m221
 What's wrong?, I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?, L621100, L621099,m221
 This is the suitcase you gave me., I gave you?, L620573, L620572,m221
 Wait!, What?, L620576, L620575,m221
 ...Who are you?," We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.", L620578, L620577,m221
" Looks almost cold now, don't it?", That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home., L645663, L645662,m226
 Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here., Let's go., L645665, L645664,m226
 It's an enemy sneak attack.  Let's get outta here!, Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew., L645671, L645670,m226
" It's no meteor, that's for sure!", Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!, L645673, L645672,m226

" Hey, there - open up!", Come on out!  We're friends!, L645695, L645694,m226
 That explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move., Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through., L645923, L645922,m226
 Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno..., All right - I've seen enough!, L645942, L645941,m226
 There's only one thing that will stop the Martians!  We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  Now there's no choice.  The United Nations has voted authority to the United States.  The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb., Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles., L645944, L645943,m226
" Hey, you!  Better get outa here!", I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors..., L646044, L646043,m226
 There's nobody left around here now., We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!, L646046, L646045,m226
 Hurry up!  Jump in!, There was a girl with them...If I could find her...., L646050, L646049,m226
 You look kinda lost yourself., But I think I know where she'll be...., L646054, L646053,m226
 Is that it over there?," Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.", L645617, L645616,m226
 Did you see it come down?, Yes...I was fishing up in the hills., L645620, L645619,m226
 You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!, Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater., L645622, L645621,m226
 What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?, He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!, L645625, L645624,m226
 You seem to know a lot about him.," Well, I did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my Masters degree.", L645627, L645626,m226
 Did it do you any good?," Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?", L645629, L645628,m226
 I'm sorry.  I don't smoke., Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!, L645631, L645630,m226
" Aw, he isn't that good...!", How can you say that when you don't know him!, L645633, L645632,m226
 I do know him...slightly., What's he like?, L645635, L645634,m226

 I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!, They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close...  I take them off., L645640, L645639,m226

 You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?, No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!, L645844, L645843,m226
 I never noticed before - that's a cowboy tie...., I bought it for the square dance. I thought I ought to wear some- thing Western., L645874, L645873,m226
 Is that... machine...?, It's gone now., L645876, L645875,m226
 Where are we?," Southwest of Corona, somewhere. There must have been another cylinder down here.  They've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out.  There's a farmhouse.  Let's see if we can find something to eat...!", L645878, L645877,m226

" No, on the campus.  I haven't any family."," I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.", L645883, L645882,m226

" We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.", But they seem to murder everything that moves...!, L645888, L645887,m226
 I've been as close to them as anyone. But not close enough for real observation..., I feel like I did one time when I was small.  Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.  They found me in a church.  I was afraid to go in any place else., L645891, L645890,m226

 He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!," But you're not going to.  You're not the kind.  You're tired, anyway.  You've been up all night.  You cracked up in a plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you want to know something?  It doesn't show on you at all.", L645895, L645894,m226

 What was it like?, I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!, L645904, L645903,m226

 They've blocked it!," It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!", L645913, L645912,m226
 Is it possible to go in right after the explosion?," Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?", L645982, L645981,m226
 Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!, I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way., L645984, L645983,m226
 My kid brother has one.  You know why?, Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet., L645986, L645985,m226

" That's what knocked the phones out, too.", How could it happen to everybody's watch together?, L645715, L645714,m226
 That needle ain't pointing north!, It's pointing out to the gully - where that meteor came down., L645718, L645717,m226
 What is that gizmo?!, I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet., L645733, L645732,m226
 This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!, It might give us something., L645968, L645967,m226
 A forlorn hope - but there is a chance., It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians., L646014, L646013,m226
 We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!," If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...", L646017, L646016,m226

" I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?", Right., L645591, L645590,m226

" There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!"," So is the town, I notice!", L645783, L645782,m226
 I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate., I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted., L645785, L645784,m226
 Colonel - shooting's no good!, It's always been a good persuader., L645814, L645813,m226
" General Mann -- I was told to expect you, sir.  I'm Colonel Heffner."," I'm here to make up a report, not to interfere with the operations you've set up.  You're still in command.  Clayton Forrester!  I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.", L645787, L645786,m226
 That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here., Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far., L645793, L645792,m226
" We will, sir!"," From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?", L645802, L645801,m226
 My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.," That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.", L645805, L645804,m226
" Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!", They'll probably move at dawn., L645807, L645806,m226
 That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?, It was nearer than that., L645578, L645577,m226
" Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.  My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church."," Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!", L645645, L645644,m226
 They don't do much of anything...!, There's a square dance at the social hall this evening., L645659, L645658,m226
 They are living creatures out there., But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --, L645818, L645817,m226
" Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.", I've done about all I can do here. You go back in.  Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.  He's a good man., L645823, L645822,m226

 We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.," Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.", L645587, L645586,m226
 I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.," Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?", L645589, L645588,m226
 Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit. We won't have to feed it!," We sell the tamales, enchiladas - hot dogs!", L645609, L645608,m226
 Must be somebody in there., Who?  Where d'you think they come from!, L645677, L645676,m226
 Maybe these are not men - not like us., Everything human don't have to look like you and me...., L645681, L645680,m226

 Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.  So there you were--," There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.", L10251, L10250,m232
 Doesn't mean you had to marry her., We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks., L10253, L10252,m232
" Okay, good reason.  Then what?"," It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.", L10255, L10254,m232

 You wanna know what I think?," Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.", L10025, L10024,m232

 Computer!  I've turned all the cooling units back on!  What's wrong?," The reaction has proceeded too far. The core has begun to melt.  Engines will overload in 2 minutes, 35 seconds.", L24123, L24122,m236
" Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.", Has the hull been breached?, L23355, L23354,m236
 How long to fix?, Hard to say., L23360, L23359,m236
" Well, get started.", Right.  Talk to you., L23362, L23361,m236
" Hello, Faust!", Yeah!, L23378, L23377,m236
 <u>He</u> died., What?, L23462, L23461,m236
" Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna charge up the engines for a minute, okay?"," Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.", L23520, L23519,m236
 Yes?  What is it?," Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.", L23539, L23538,m236
" Why, what's wrong?"," The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.", L23541, L23540,m236
 What do you mean?," It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases.  I'll just read it to you the way I got it:  ""... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... ""  And that's all it could translate.", L23543, L23542,m236
 You like this shit?, It grows on you., L23814, L23813,m236
 You know what they make this stuff out of?," Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.", L23816, L23815,m236
" But we can't kill it.  If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space.", Shit..., L23833, L23832,m236
" We could cut a section out of that metallite netting.  It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong.", We have to avoid injuring it.  What we really need is some electric animal prods., L23850, L23849,m236
 Where's it coming from?," Machine's screwed up, I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial.", L23879, L23878,m236
 Okay., That way., L23883, L23882,m236
 What happened to the lights?," Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.", L23885, L23884,m236
 Where does that go?, All over the ship, L23921, L23920,m236
 What happened?  Where's Sandy?, Dead., L23977, L23976,m236
 Dead!," It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.", L23979, L23978,m236
 What the hell's going on?, Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow., L23608, L23607,m236
 Hurt!  How?, Don't know -- maybe we'll be real lucky and he just broke his neck.  I knew we shouldn't of come down here., L23610, L23609,m236
 Oh -- God -- oh --, Is it alive?, L23624, L23623,m236
" Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt.  Any bets on the top bid?"," Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet.", L23804, L23803,m236
" Oh, no.  Oh, no.", What was that?  What the Christ was that?, L23827, L23826,m236
 And then we run out of food and oxygen., The water will still recycle., L23838, L23837,m236
 That one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets -- you notice?  The food storage room on one end --, -- And the cooling unit on the other., L23925, L23924,m236
" Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you won't need me, but if you do, I'm here.", Right., L23942, L23941,m236
" Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.", Damn it!  How long to fix?, L23358, L23357,m236
 Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?, Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out..., L23466, L23465,m236
 And when will you be ready to do that?, Oh -- I'm not near ready yet., L23468, L23467,m236
 Then why the hell are you sitting around here?, Right., L23470, L23469,m236
 It's really on there tight.," Here, let me try.", L23631, L23630,m236
" Hey, guess what?", What?, L23761, L23760,m236
 This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!," Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!", L23775, L23774,m236
" Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag than this, but I've had worse too, if you know what I mean.", I kind of like it., L23812, L23811,m236
 So does anybody have any suggestions?, We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it., L23843, L23842,m236
 Might even incinerate the damn thing., I hope not., L23864, L23863,m236
 It's clear., All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust.  Hunter and I will make up the second team., L23873, L23872,m236
 It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles., Well we better do something., L23903, L23902,m236
 So it's trapped in between -- now we have to drive it out., Poison gas..., L23927, L23926,m236
" Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?", Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now., L23972, L23971,m236
 There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge.  I'll go get it.," No, I don't want us separated.", L23990, L23989,m236
 All right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks., Right. , L23995, L23994,m236
 He wouldn't open the lock," Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here.  Maybe <u>you</u> deserve to get slapped.", L23640, L23639,m236
 Where did it come from?, <u>He's</u> the only one that knows that., L23647, L23646,m236
 Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.," Yeah, but how?  His nose and mouth are blocked.", L23650, L23649,m236
 We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.," Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.", L23659, L23658,m236
 We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.," How about cutting it off?  We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.", L23661, L23660,m236
" God, that smoke's poisonous!", It's eating a hole in the floor!, L23667, L23666,m236
 I never saw anything like that in my life... except molecular acid., But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>., L23678, L23677,m236
 It makes me sick to see him like that., Isn't there some way we can get it off him?, L23690, L23689,m236
 It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive., You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits..., L23706, L23705,m236
 We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose., We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers., L23831, L23830,m236
" It's over, Hunter."," Boy, that's terrific.", L23252, L23251,m236
" That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?", It wouldn't come., L23628, L23627,m236
" Hey now, what is this?", Ask him., L23636, L23635,m236
 There.  Should be coming through about there.," Careful, don't get under it!", L23672, L23671,m236
 I'll do it.  The rest of you continue., I'll come with you., L23712, L23711,m236
" You know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo.", What do you mean?, L23714, L23713,m236
" Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.", How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead., L23716, L23715,m236
 Now we're in for it., The door was closed.  It must still be in here., L23720, L23719,m236
" No, don't open the door.  We don't want it escaping."," Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --", L23722, L23721,m236
 Yes?, How's Broussard?, L23736, L23735,m236
 He's running a fever., Still unconscious?, L23738, L23737,m236
 Yes., Can you do anything for him?, L23740, L23739,m236
 The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong., Good., L23742, L23741,m236
 I think I could cobble something together.  A long metal rod with a battery in it.  Give it a hell of a shock.," Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm issuing a standing order: from this moment forth, every one of us will wear protective garments, including helmets.  Let's get down to the locker and change.", L23852, L23851,m236
" Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive.", How do we locate the creature?, L23866, L23865,m236
 Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth., Don't be an idiot., L23905, L23904,m236
 We can't pump poison gas down into the cooling unit!  It'll flood the whole ship!, The only other thing I can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out., L23929, L23928,m236
 While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net., Sounds like a rough one., L23935, L23934,m236
 We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level, At least it can't get up here now., L23982, L23981,m236
" Listen, it sure didn't like this flamethrower."," That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.", L23987, L23986,m236
 We've got six hours left., Oh my God., L24020, L24019,m236
 Oh no!  We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men!, I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers., L24029, L24028,m236
 <u>How</u>?, It's time for drastic remedies., L24031, L24030,m236
" If we could just get the <u>creature</u> into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up.", Good!  That's good!, L24050, L24049,m236
 You can't say that, The flamethrower needs more fuel., L24056, L24055,m236
 The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back., Should we go outside and bring him in?, L24072, L24071,m236
 It will be., What we really need is some red meat in here for bait., L24078, L24077,m236
 Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.," Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... ", L24081, L24080,m236
 It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything., Let me go first, L24098, L24097,m236
 The flamethrower!," I can't, the acid will pour out!", L24100, L24099,m236
 Now what's wrong?, I've completely lost their signal., L23510, L23509,m236
 Can you get them back?, I'm trying., L23512, L23511,m236
 What?  What was that?, The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning., L23528, L23527,m236
 I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them., No., L23559, L23558,m236
" What do you mean, no?", We're not going anywhere., L23561, L23560,m236
 But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now., We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board., L23563, L23562,m236
" Why, you chickenshit bastard --", Just can that crap!  I'm in command here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's leaving this ship!, L23565, L23564,m236
 I've got 'em!  They're back on my screens!, How many?, L23597, L23596,m236
 Oh no.," Jay, this is Cleave!  Meet me at the main air lock!", L23604, L23603,m236
" I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.", I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled., L23643, L23642,m236
 Look at that., What is it -- I can't tell anything --, L23653, L23652,m236
 It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat., Oh... God..., L23655, L23654,m236
 I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him., It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive., L23657, L23656,m236
 What's happening up here?, I think it's fizzled out., L23676, L23675,m236
 This is horrible., Hey!  what about the film?, L23698, L23697,m236
 That must have been when he got it.," The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.", L23702, L23701,m236
 What common objects?," Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?", L23710, L23709,m236
 You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?, It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken., L23975, L23974,m236
 Don't count on it., We sure need this flamethrower., L23993, L23992,m236
 Recognizable!  In that?," In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.", L24002, L24001,m236
 Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?," And right next to it, that oval design with the markings -- it's a dead ringer for the spore casings.", L24004, L24003,m236
 ... And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.," You will notice, though, that there are no more phases.  Only four forms are shown.  After that the pattern repeats.", L24011, L24010,m236
 We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.," I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.", L24035, L24034,m236
 Blow the ship up?, And the creature with it.  We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat., L24041, L24040,m236
 What about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold?  That's the only reason we came out here. We'd have to abandon them all.  We'd be broke.," Our lives are more important. Anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat.", L24045, L24044,m236
 I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat., We can use the flamethrower., L24053, L24052,m236
 This should do it., I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it., L24076, L24075,m236
" Isn't ""bait"" the word you used?"," Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!", L24083, L24082,m236
" Just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all.", Is it armed?, L24087, L24086,m236
" If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.", Thanks for the thought. , L24089, L24088,m236
" Sandy, you want to give us some vision?", Feast your eyes., L23263, L23262,m236
 First contact...," Sandy, can you home in on that beam?", L23298, L23297,m236
 What's the frequency?," Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?", L23300, L23299,m236
" I've got it.  It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.", Dell -- show me that on a screen., L23303, L23302,m236
" Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  How long till dawn?", Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes., L23369, L23368,m236
" Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?"," Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.", L23375, L23374,m236
 Receiving.," All right.  Now just remember: keep away from those weapons unless I say otherwise.  Martin, do you read me?", L23403, L23402,m236
 That way., You lead., L23408, L23407,m236
 What's wrong?, My signal's fading., L23414, L23413,m236
" It's close, real close.", How far?, L23420, L23419,m236
 Air lock?, Who knows?, L23431, L23430,m236
" Doesn't seem much doubt about it, does there?", That creature sure must have considered it important... using his last strength to draw it..., L23497, L23496,m236
 This looks ancient.," Can't tell -- these weather conditions could erode anything, fast.", L23514, L23513,m236
 What'd he say?, I couldn't make it out -- too much interference., L23557, L23556,m236
" If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.", Sun will be down in a minute., L23569, L23568,m236
 Here's his line.  We can haul him out of there if we have to., It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something., L23576, L23575,m236
 But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact., Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes., L23578, L23577,m236
" There, it caught!"," Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?", L23582, L23581,m236
" No, it's coming.", Can you see anything?, L23584, L23583,m236
 <u>What is it</u>?," <u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!", L23590, L23589,m236
" Oh God, oh God no.", Help me -- I'm going to try to get it off., L23592, L23591,m236
 It won't come -- it's stuck., What is it?, L23594, L23593,m236
 It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too., Let's let the machine work on him., L23634, L23633,m236
 It's stopped?," Yes, thank heaven.", L23681, L23680,m236
 We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it., Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans., L23683, L23682,m236
" No, thank God... just missed him.", Is it still dripping?, L23687, L23686,m236
 That sounds a little fanciful...," Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation...", L23708, L23707,m236
 Too primitive.  It's a pre- technological construction.  That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best., They're from a dead civilization, L23758, L23757,m236
 We're going home.  We're in hyperspace., We're going into the freezers now., L23800, L23799,m236
" I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it ""The Snark Log.""", The commander normally has first publication rights., L23806, L23805,m236

 How?," Room by room, corridor by corridor.", L23846, L23845,m236
 And what do we do when we find it?," We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it.", L23848, L23847,m236
 I thought I'd find you here.," I was thinking of a line from an old poem: ""Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink.""  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.", L23854, L23853,m236

 What would you say that was supposed to mean?, Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them..., L23482, L23481,m236

To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?", L142963, L142962,m304
 Do you love your parents?, I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine., L142965, L142964,m304
 Did you love him?, Yes.  Very much., L142967, L142966,m304
 So.  Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?, Some of my best friends are scientists., L143062, L143061,m304
 I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors., Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive., L143064, L143063,m304
" Not exactly.  It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.", Maybe you're creating a monster., L143066, L143065,m304
 I don't think so., Why?, L143068, L143067,m304
 It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary," In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.", L143070, L143069,m304
" Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --", If you came back., L143073, L143072,m304
 If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth., Something like that., L143075, L143074,m304
 If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't., You're willing to die for this., L143078, L143077,m304
 I read your book., Really., L143081, L143080,m304
 Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy., What'd you think?, L143083, L143082,m304
 I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President., I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question., L143085, L143084,m304
 I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.," I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.", L143087, L143086,m304
" Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?", I don't follow., L143089, L143088,m304
 Do you really believe your life is meaningless?, I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility., L143092, L143091,m304
" And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?", It's getting late..., L143094, L143093,m304
 Ellie --, It's late.  We should go back., L143098, L143097,m304
 ... Another question I would ask would be a very simple one.  How did you do it?  How did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves?," An excellent question, Doctor.  But what if we don't like the answer?", L143101, L143100,m304
 How do you mean?," What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy.  A thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out of control, violent crime, no food... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social.  The weak.  The sick.  The unwanted.  And ever since we've been doing great.'", L143103, L143102,m304
 Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...," I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?", L143169, L143168,m304

 You're trembling., I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow., L143176, L143175,m304
 What...?, I'm sorry., L143179, L143178,m304
" Ellie, what is it?", I'm sorry -- I can't --, L143182, L143181,m304
 What?, I can't do this --, L143184, L143183,m304
 What are you so afraid of?," Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --", L143186, L143185,m304
 What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?, Please --, L143188, L143187,m304
" I'm in love with you, Ellie.", Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --, L143190, L143189,m304
 And then what?  Then you'll be safe?, -- I don't know --, L143192, L143191,m304
" Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?", I can't hear this now --, L143194, L143193,m304
" Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone."," And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.", L143196, L143195,m304
 Hi., Hi., L143345, L143344,m304
 I'm assuming you read my deposition., It was quite a page turner., L143347, L143346,m304
 So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?, I'm not sure it's come to that., L143350, L143349,m304
 They don't believe me., I do., L143352, L143351,m304
 You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.," It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.", L143354, L143353,m304
" I don't have any proof, Palmer."," Ellie, you're the proof.  You tell them your story.  Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.", L143356, L143355,m304
" It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real."," Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!", L143358, L143357,m304
 But --," Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!", L143360, L143359,m304
" I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true."," Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.", L143362, L143361,m304
" ... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer:  Why would they send me back without proof?"," Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.", L143401, L143400,m304
" In other words, God works in mysterious ways...", In other words., L143403, L143402,m304
" I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...", Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?, L143405, L143404,m304
 I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves., Meaning..., L143407, L143406,m304
" You have a question, Dr. Arroway?", I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile., L143046, L143045,m304
 It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.," Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --", L143048, L143047,m304
" Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.  But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.", Y'know what?  Fine.  I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them., L143050, L143049,m304
" You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it."," How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?", L143106, L143105,m304
" I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --"," Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --", L143108, L143107,m304
 Oh my God..., What is it?, L142816, L142815,m304
" Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.", But --, L142835, L142834,m304

 It all starts with them going to the bathroom together., That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that., L151186, L151185,m314
 Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.," What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.", L151188, L151187,m314
 I'm lucky Jen's not like that., I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy., L151190, L151189,m314
" My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere."," Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.", L151192, L151191,m314
 Waiter! She needs more water., Can we get some service here?, L151585, L151584,m314

" Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?"," Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.", L151572, L151571,m314
" No one I've run into knows what ""coyote ugly"" means."," Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe ""coyote ugly"" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally ""ugly"" but is really beautiful.", L151576, L151575,m314
 Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different., I've changed a lot lately., L151600, L151599,m314

 Wow your body's really hot., I've been working out., L151611, L151610,m314
 I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?, Never felt better., L151613, L151612,m314
 A bite... Where'd you get bitten?, At Victoria's Secret., L151250, L151249,m314

 How's the rest of your health?, Good. Except for PMS., L151258, L151257,m314
 PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?, It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and..., L151260, L151259,m314

 That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?, Nearly four., L151464, L151463,m314
 How have you been feeling?," Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.", L151466, L151465,m314
 Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?, I get crazy dreams and I black out., L151468, L151467,m314
" Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called ""The PMS Diet,"" which may be helpful.", Does she have PMS?, L151470, L151469,m314
 Jennifer?, No it's mom., L151637, L151636,m314

 Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me., Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy., L151156, L151155,m314
 Translation: a total geek., Anything's better than Mark., L151158, L151157,m314
 My shrink says he's not so bad.," Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job.", L151160, L151159,m314
 He's a very talented musician., Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out., L151162, L151161,m314
 I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes., So don't look in his eyes., L151164, L151163,m314
 I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time., People notice you Frida., L151168, L151167,m314
 He hasn't said one word to me., Maybe he's just shy., L151179, L151178,m314
 My date always pays more attention to you than to me.," Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.", L151181, L151180,m314
 Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS., I get a little bloated sometimes., L151183, L151182,m314
" How about I give you a make-over? You'll feel better about yourself. You're actually pretty, you're just not bringing it out.", You're just saying that., L151196, L151195,m314
 Do you really need these?, Only to see., L151198, L151197,m314
 Can't you get contacts?," No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.", L151200, L151199,m314
 Or if there's a full moon., Or if your boyfriend's an asshole., L151207, L151206,m314
" Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.", What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?, L151227, L151226,m314
 It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing., I don't know., L151229, L151228,m314
 Where are all the mediums?," Frida, grab that red one.", L151236, L151235,m314
 Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?, And she got the medium., L151243, L151242,m314
 I think she broke the skin., What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room., L151246, L151245,m314
 George bit you?," I kind of asked him to. We were, you know... he got a little carried away...", L151248, L151247,m314

 You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.," What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. ""Can I use your phone?"" ""How about a nightcap?"" ""I want to meet your cat."" And my all-time favorite, the old standby, ""I have to use your bathroom.""", L151310, L151309,m314
 Maybe they have to pee.," Are you kidding? He might as well say, ""Can I date rape you?""", L151312, L151311,m314
 I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?," They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.", L151314, L151313,m314
 Where?, Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!, L151317, L151316,m314

" Hey, did you get contacts?"," Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.", L151322, L151321,m314
 He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?," There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.", L151391, L151390,m314
 And he was ripped limb from limb?, I'm sure they were exaggerating., L151393, L151392,m314
 Why would they exaggerate?, To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back., L151395, L151394,m314
 So did you do it?, Did I kill him? Of course not!, L151397, L151396,m314
" No, did you fuck him?", No. I don't think so., L151399, L151398,m314
 You don't think so? You either did or your didn't., I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone., L151401, L151400,m314
 Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads., I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory., L151403, L151402,m314
 I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years., I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me., L151405, L151404,m314
 What? Why the hell did he do that?, He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!, L151407, L151406,m314
 And then?, I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out., L151409, L151408,m314
 At least your PMS is over., And my bra finally fits again., L151411, L151410,m314

" He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.", Rule one: always wear make-up., L151418, L151417,m314
 I wonder if he's married., He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar., L151420, L151419,m314
" Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?"," Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.", L151433, L151432,m314
 Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month., I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat., L151435, L151434,m314
 I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup., Hmmm. Sounds suspicious., L151523, L151522,m314
 I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?, Give him the tampon test., L151525, L151524,m314
 What the hell is the tampon test?," You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, ""I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?"" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out...", L151527, L151526,m314
 I'm freaking out. I'm like an animal and totally out of control. My arms keep getting really hairy., You have to stop being so self- critical Frida., L151549, L151548,m314
 How'd it go with the cop?, We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked., L151552, L151551,m314
" Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.", It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep., L151554, L151553,m314
" No he didn't. Come on, I don't want to be alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.", Okay. I guess so., L151558, L151557,m314
 I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.," Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.", L151565, L151564,m314
 What did he say?, I think he called you beautiful., L151569, L151568,m314
 Charming Carlton., It is so hot in here., L151579, L151578,m314
" Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word ""bag."" It used to be ""No, that's not my bag"" -- meaning not my thing. But now ""my bag"" means ""my fault.""", I still thought it was a purse., L151581, L151580,m314
 You might want to tape your nipples down next time. It's really distracting., I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS., L151588, L151587,m314
" Geez, I wish I'd get it like that."," No you don't, believe me.", L151590, L151589,m314
" Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!", No they're not., L151592, L151591,m314
 Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!, It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that., L151594, L151593,m314
" Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.", There is a man's arm in my bed., L151628, L151627,m314
 Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's., You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you., L151631, L151630,m314
 Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?," Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now.", L151634, L151633,m314
 So where's this infamous arm now?, I put it down the garbage disposal., L151660, L151659,m314
 And what makes you think you killed a man?," Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!", L151662, L151661,m314
" You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?"," No, last night I think I chased Carlton around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts.", L151664, L151663,m314
 You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head., It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!, L151666, L151665,m314
 Maybe the blood was from your period like before., I haven't gotten it yet., L151668, L151667,m314
" Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?", I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me., L151670, L151669,m314
 Hello?, Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?, L151730, L151729,m314
 I've been here. What day is it?, Tuesday. Are you okay?, L151732, L151731,m314
" Shit, I guess I missed work."," Frida, Carlton's dead.", L151734, L151733,m314
 Oh no., And he was missing an arm., L151736, L151735,m314
 Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession., Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or..., L151738, L151737,m314
 Get rid of him!," Okay, I gotta go.", L151743, L151742,m314
" Holy shit, I don't know.", Did you get rid of Mark?, L151765, L151764,m314
 I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there., He's been here all night?, L151767, L151766,m314
 What happened to his tooth?, I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!, L151776, L151775,m314
 DON'T call the police., Why not? There's been a murder., L151778, L151777,m314
" First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.", What? Why'd you do that?, L151780, L151779,m314
 There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.," You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?", L151782, L151781,m314
 How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?," You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.", L151784, L151783,m314
" You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.", I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him., L151786, L151785,m314
 Why the fuck would you do that?, I could smell another woman on him., L151788, L151787,m314
" If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.", That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor., L151790, L151789,m314
 At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark., You should have seen it erect., L151799, L151798,m314
 You expecting someone?, No., L151801, L151800,m314
" Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in.", Tell them you'll meet them outside., L151804, L151803,m314
 What the fuck are we going to do?, Hide him., L151809, L151808,m314
 Peter knows something.," Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.", L151856, L151855,m314
 I think I just got my period., Does that mean this whole thing is over?, L151864, L151863,m314
 Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works., Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web., L151866, L151865,m314
 You're such a good friend.," So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this.", L151868, L151867,m314
" Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...", Peter keeps asking me out., L151892, L151891,m314
" Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you."," The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.", L151894, L151893,m314
" ""Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control", Check out what I found., L151926, L151925,m314
" This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. ""The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love.""", Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years., L151929, L151928,m314
" ""The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves."" See I knew you never loved Mark.", Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her., L151931, L151930,m314
 She died at age 34 in the 1800's. They thought she was crazy. She was banished from her town. Seems her husband shot her., Guess she never found true love., L151933, L151932,m314
 The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet., So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?, L151935, L151934,m314
 What choice do we have?, So what do I do?, L151937, L151936,m314
 Fall in love., I think I already have., L151939, L151938,m314
 I'm cleaning my stove., You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself., L151958, L151957,m314
 I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean., You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks., L151960, L151959,m314
 I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him., Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine., L151962, L151961,m314
 But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?, I guess you'll find out., L151964, L151963,m314
 No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself., No. I won't let you do that., L151966, L151965,m314
 I think George knows., About Mark? Carlton?, L151969, L151968,m314
 About Benito., Did I kill a guy named Benito?, L151971, L151970,m314
 I thought you and George were getting married., We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!, L151974, L151973,m314
 I wish I only had your problems., Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?, L151976, L151975,m314
 Hello?, Frida? You okay?, L152034, L152033,m314
 Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive., Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over., L152036, L152035,m314
 God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower., Sure. See ya., L152038, L152037,m314
 I know., So you're Grant's secretary?, L151272, L151271,m314
 I do development for TV movies.," Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.", L151274, L151273,m314
" You're kidding, really?"," No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?", L151276, L151275,m314
 You hungry?, Starving., L151324, L151323,m314
" Man I'm starving too, I think I'll go for the Surf and Turf.", I'm not really hungry after all., L151327, L151326,m314
" So there I was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, ""Son, you got into Harvard!"" It took three of them to pull me back! Frida keeps eating."," Well, whattdaya think?", L151333, L151332,m314
 I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.," Hey, how about a little nightcap?", L151337, L151336,m314
 I'm really tired.," Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?", L151339, L151338,m314
" No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.", They say sex is great for cramps., L151341, L151340,m314
 What?, I really gotta pee., L151345, L151344,m314
 You should have gone at the restaurant., I didn't have to pee then., L151347, L151346,m314
 My apartment's just such a mess., That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave., L151349, L151348,m314
 Oh come on. Knock it off., Knock what off?, L151351, L151350,m314
 You don't have to pee., Yes I do have to pee!, L151353, L151352,m314
 You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.," I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.", L151355, L151354,m314
 Uh huh. So pee., So pee? Here?, L151357, L151356,m314
" What, you got a date or somethin'?", Since when do you care?, L151288, L151287,m314
 You look different. I mean you look good., You never say that., L151291, L151290,m314
 You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?, No., L151293, L151292,m314
 Look what you did!," Oh my god, I'm sorry!", L151296, L151295,m314
 Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.," I can't help it, it smells so good.", L151298, L151297,m314
" OUCH that stings! Damn, what am I going to do with my back like this?", Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?, L151301, L151300,m314
" Frida, you know you're it for me.", Yeah right... You better go., L151303, L151302,m314
" Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...", You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!, L151305, L151304,m314
 Where'd you get the bike?," I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?", L151480, L151479,m314
 Frida? I hear you talking. I know you're in there. Let me in., It's Mark., L151741, L151740,m314
 It's a matter of life and death., This really isn't a good time., L151746, L151745,m314
 I did something stupid. I had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport. It turned out to be money -- so I kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me., So pay them back and apologize., L151749, L151748,m314
 These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs., You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?, L151751, L151750,m314
 It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened., Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me., L151753, L151752,m314
" Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.", My bra is my biggest supporter., L151755, L151754,m314
 Mark., Yeah?, L151760, L151759,m314
 Wow., Take your shower., L151762, L151761,m314
 The Nielson's?, On your desk., L151215, L151214,m314
 Script coverage?, On your desk., L151217, L151216,m314
 Coffee and..., Your desk., L151219, L151218,m314
" How about a ""Man in Jeopardy"" story?", Did you change your hair?, L151439, L151438,m314
 I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.," Yes, that's what we're looking for.", L151460, L151459,m314
 I think we should do something with strong female characters..., I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk., L151462, L151461,m314
 Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was talking about?, Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women., L151870, L151869,m314
 No., No?, L151872, L151871,m314
" No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.", Very well then. Is that all?, L151874, L151873,m314
 When's the last time you saw him?," We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.", L151377, L151376,m314
 I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.," Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.", L151383, L151382,m314
 You busted me., Are you following me?, L151473, L151472,m314
 No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why., Intriguing?, L151475, L151474,m314
 I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag., At least let me give you this back. I washed it., L151477, L151476,m314
 Being a cop has such a warm effect on people., That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me., L151484, L151483,m314
 You wanna get some coffee?, I'm trying to stay away from caffeine., L151487, L151486,m314
 Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off., No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently., L151489, L151488,m314
 Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together., So what book did you buy?, L151491, L151490,m314
" Oh, it's nothing."," No really, I love knowing what people read.", L151493, L151492,m314
 It's stupid., I can forgive you a bestseller., L151495, L151494,m314
 My mom used to get PMS too., Used to? Did it stop finally?, L151497, L151496,m314
" No, she died when I was twelve.", I'm sorry., L151499, L151498,m314
 I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.," Oh my god, by wolves?", L151501, L151500,m314
 We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.," I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.", L151503, L151502,m314
" I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.", Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something., L151506, L151505,m314
 Like what?, You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear., L151508, L151507,m314
 A lot of people don't wear underwear., Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line., L151510, L151509,m314
 How about you? Briefs or boxers?, Briefs., L151513, L151512,m314
 Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up., Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?, L151515, L151514,m314
 I really gotta get going., Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?, L151518, L151517,m314
 Yeah. Maybe., Goodnight., L151520, L151519,m314
 What are those?, Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix., L151532, L151531,m314
 What are they for?, Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets., L151534, L151533,m314
" I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left..."," Okay, you busted me.", L151538, L151537,m314
 What's wrong?," Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?", L151540, L151539,m314
 I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?," No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.", L151545, L151544,m314
" Oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. You following me again?", No. I was doing my laundry., L151647, L151646,m314
 Was there anything in that washer?," No. Nope, nothing in it.", L151651, L151650,m314
" You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?", NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first., L151653, L151652,m314
 Everything okay?, A man killed in Central Park., L151658, L151657,m314
 Uh.... hi!," Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.", L151806, L151805,m314
 You had a date with Carlton?, It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them., L151824, L151823,m314
" No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date.", Mark wouldn't hurt a fly., L151845, L151844,m314
 But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?, Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it., L151848, L151847,m314
" No, why?", He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment., L151851, L151850,m314
 Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?, Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?, L151876, L151875,m314
 I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?," No, I got it. It's okay.", L151878, L151877,m314
 What happened?," I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.", L151881, L151880,m314
 I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.," Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.", L151883, L151882,m314
 Except Mark of course., What's that supposed to mean?, L151885, L151884,m314
 Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?," No, but thanks for the warning.", L151887, L151886,m314
 Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country., Interesting possibility., L151889, L151888,m314
" That's it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. She'd say, ""You're talking to Betty now"" and we'd leave the house for a few days."," This is a lot worse than ""Betty.""", L151900, L151899,m314
 You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.," No, my bite's a lot worse.", L151902, L151901,m314
 Is it that funny?," No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say ""I love you too"" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.", L151905, L151904,m314
 Is that how you feel?," Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.", L151907, L151906,m314
 You didn't say it., I love you too., L151909, L151908,m314
 What's with the squirt guns?, They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper., L151911, L151910,m314
" You know, I've never seen your cat.", I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely..., L151913, L151912,m314
 Your breasts feel larger., They do? Oh no..., L151941, L151940,m314
 I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs., No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?, L151944, L151943,m314
 Hello?," Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.", L151982, L151981,m314
 NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever., What? Is there someone else?, L151984, L151983,m314
" Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really."," Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?", L151986, L151985,m314
 You at least owe me the truth., You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?, L151988, L151987,m314
" Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.", No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf., L151990, L151989,m314
" If you don't like me, just say so. You don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf.", I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away!, L151992, L151991,m314
 Go away. I might hurt you., I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you., L152004, L152003,m314
 Peter I love you too but..., I don't think you'll hurt me., L152006, L152005,m314
 How do you know?, I don't think you would. No matter what form you take., L152008, L152007,m314
 I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you., I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?, L152010, L152009,m314
 Be careful!, Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?, L152013, L152012,m314
 No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately., I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me., L152015, L152014,m314
 I knew you wouldn't kill me., Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child., L152019, L152018,m314
 We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems., Worse than this?, L152021, L152020,m314
" Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.", What about... those guys... I might have..., L152023, L152022,m314
 No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves., I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that., L152025, L152024,m314
 I'm going to take a shower., Okay., L152030, L152029,m314
 Here's a towel., Thanks., L152042, L152041,m314
 That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.," Oh, I see... interesting theory.", L151225, L151224,m314
 I think I'm a werewolf., Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?, L151672, L151671,m314
 I ate a guy last night., And how did you feel when you ate this guy?, L151674, L151673,m314
 Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty., We didn't have sex., L151677, L151676,m314
" You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose ""eating him"" as the method of killing?", Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!, L151679, L151678,m314
 It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.," Oh my god, what happened?", L151366, L151365,m314
 Yes... I... we had dinner., Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?, L151373, L151372,m314
" No, it was our first date.", Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral., L151375, L151374,m314
 A kiss? Did you have sex with him?," No, I said it was our first date.", L151379, L151378,m314
 We can get a warrant if you like.," No, take it.", L151388, L151387,m314
 You heard about Carlton Fraser?," Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?", L151822, L151821,m314
 Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive. And the last to see Gregory alive., What makes you think I was the last one?, L151826, L151825,m314
" No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.", You got a dog?, L151830, L151829,m314
" No, I have a cat.", How big?, L151832, L151831,m314
 No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport., Packages of money., L151840, L151839,m314
" So I asked the bartender what ""coyote ugly"" meant. It's like the ""bagger"" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger..."," Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.", L151171, L151170,m314
 He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time., Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms., L151205, L151204,m314
" Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.", She's just so... pathetic., L151561, L151560,m314
 She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous., She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad., L151563, L151562,m314
 I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?, Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky., L151616, L151615,m314
 It's for you. Frida., Tell her I'm eating., L151626, L151625,m314
 I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?, It's so bad she becomes a werewolf., L151682, L151681,m314
 You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?," Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.", L151684, L151683,m314
 Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?, Take some allergy medicine., L151686, L151685,m314
 You can't believe this bullshit.," She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.", L151688, L151687,m314
 Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.," Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.", L151371, L151370,m314
 How the hell is that your business?, We're just trying to figure out what happened., L151381, L151380,m314
 You want her sheets?, We can just take this pillowcase., L151386, L151385,m314
 I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?, Why would you want to be a cop?, L151816, L151815,m314
 See he was cheating from the get go., He's been running money for the Mafia., L151838, L151837,m314
" Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too."," Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?", L151278, L151277,m314
 You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk., You're some catch Lloyd., L151280, L151279,m314
 He was found a few blocks away., Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess., L151368, L151367,m314
" I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.", That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?, L151422, L151421,m314
" Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick."," Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?", L151424, L151423,m314
" No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.", I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation., L151426, L151425,m314
 Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know., I told you she was innocent., L151445, L151444,m314
" Hey, there was a lot of blood.", She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this., L151447, L151446,m314
 Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?, Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse., L151450, L151449,m314
 Madonna's in Penthouse?," Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.", L151452, L151451,m314
 What?, And you think I'm sick?, L151455, L151454,m314
 He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park., And he was missing an arm., L151697, L151696,m314
 I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase., We only live a few blocks apart., L151720, L151719,m314
" This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead."," Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.", L151722, L151721,m314
 She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.," She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.", L151724, L151723,m314
 Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.," You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.", L151726, L151725,m314
" Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.", The park dude was missing an arm., L151793, L151792,m314
" Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes."," Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.", L151795, L151794,m314
 Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive..., She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was., L151797, L151796,m314
 He means the last that we know of., This one walk you home too?, L151828, L151827,m314
 Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead., One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed., L151842, L151841,m314
 Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings., It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense., L151858, L151857,m314
 It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes., Like a vampire or some shit?, L151860, L151859,m314
 You think mafia hit?, Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute., L151917, L151916,m314
 It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.," Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.", L151919, L151918,m314
 What are you talking about?," I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...", L151922, L151921,m314
 What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here., Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there..., L151924, L151923,m314
 My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days., What makes her think that?, L151995, L151994,m314
 So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton., And that was 28 days ago today., L151998, L151997,m314
 Did we get those DNA tests back?, Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims., L152000, L151999,m314
 What kind of animal?, Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?, L152002, L152001,m314
 I need something to keep me awake., Looks like you need a haircut to me., L153133, L153132,m315
 Thanks.  Just some pills., Only two bucks.  Shave as well..., L153135, L153134,m315
 Sell maps?, What of?, L153139, L153138,m315
 The city.  I need to get to the ocean.," Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?", L153141, L153140,m315
" Mnunn.  Cold lately.  That night, couple weeks ago.  That was <u>real</u> cold.  Remember that?", Not really..., L153145, L153144,m315
 How long have you been here?, Maybe ten minutes...  Thatφs strange., L153173, L153172,m315
 What's he doing here?, Says he is the man's doctor...  You know..., L153292, L153291,m315
 All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute., The other one?, L153390, L153389,m315
 His wife., Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?, L153392, L153391,m315
 They don't speak English..., How will we interrogate them?, L153399, L153398,m315
 Police.  Nobody move., He tried to kill me!, L153254, L153253,m315
 Doctor!  What brings you here?, Just visiting my patient., L153316, L153315,m315
 Really?  And how is his state of mind?, He's seriously disturbed..., L153318, L153317,m315
 You seem a little edgy.  Everything okay?," Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...", L153320, L153319,m315
" To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.", Loose ends?, L153322, L153321,m315
" I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...", I don't know what you're talking about., L153457, L153456,m315
 That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time..., You are mistaken., L153459, L153458,m315
" Please, they'll kill me...", I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends., L153463, L153462,m315
 In there., Just like that?, L153465, L153464,m315
 What is this place?," You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.", L153467, L153466,m315
 Was that for real down there?, I'm afraid so., L153488, L153487,m315
" Good evening, sir.", Yes.  This way., L153062, L153061,m315
 Why are you wearing that thing on your face?," Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.", L153067, L153066,m315
" What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnφt this his case?"," Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnφt with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, howφs your mother?", L153071, L153070,m315
 Why do you want to speak to him?, A hunch.  He might be able to..., L153126, L153125,m315
 Itφs extremely important to my investigation..., Iφll be the judge of that.  Anything else?, L153128, L153127,m315
 Lost something?," What makes you think that!  If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead...", L153131, L153130,m315
 Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help., I see..., L153329, L153328,m315
" Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...", How could you have been so stupid?, L153335, L153334,m315
" Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me.  This case is very important to me.  Just a little warning:  I've got my eye on you inspector, remember that."," Yes, sir.", L153340, L153339,m315
 Dammit!," Sorry, sir.", L153088, L153087,m315
 Donφt ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?, Patricia Crenshaw., L153090, L153089,m315
 Iφm your new assistant., I didnφt requisition a secretary., L153092, L153091,m315
" Iφve taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsonφs office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.", Good., L153095, L153094,m315
" You wonφt regret this, sir.", Fine., L153097, L153096,m315
 You typed this report?," Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?", L153111, L153110,m315
 It seems fine., <u>Fine</u>?  Look here!, L153114, L153113,m315

 Do you wash your hands before you type things?," Why, yes.", L153118, L153117,m315
 Who is it?, Won't say.  Says he must talk to you., L153412, L153411,m315
 I need everything on the Jonathan White case.," Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?", L153416, L153415,m315
 Where are we going?, Shut-up., L153267, L153266,m315
 Why give yourself up?, I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared., L153420, L153419,m315
 That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?, I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there., L153422, L153421,m315
 People...  after me., Who?, L153424, L153423,m315
 I don't know who they are., Why are they after you?, L153426, L153425,m315
 Don't know that either.," Don't know much, do you?", L153428, L153427,m315
 They didn't have faces., What?, L153448, L153447,m315
 Go on.," Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there.", L153453, L153452,m315
 Where do you think this goes?, It sure isn't the fun-fair., L153472, L153471,m315
 What now?, This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be?, L153492, L153491,m315
 Can't let you in...  sorry.," I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.", L153371, L153370,m315

 Look!  This is a good one!, What is that door?, L153509, L153508,m315
 Which one?, There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where does it go?, L153511, L153510,m315
 Such a joker!  Like your father., No.  Have a look., L153513, L153512,m315
 You see it?, Yes., L153515, L153514,m315
 Where does it lead?, It must be a closet or something., L153517, L153516,m315

 Water?, Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?, L153195, L153194,m315
 What does she say?  The woman.," Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.", L153197, L153196,m315

 I know that. But what's the maximum?, In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds., L205094, L205093,m346
 At topspeed...and adjusting distance for Degree of Miniaturization --  The sub should get through the Heart in fifty-seven seconds., That would give us only three seconds to revive him..., L205096, L205095,m346

 If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...," They have...  But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size.", L204876, L204875,m346
 I assume Benes knows how to control it.," That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.", L204878, L204877,m346

 Listen...the Heart., Yes...slowed down agreat deal., L205115, L205114,m346

" Cora, is something wrong with the laser?"," I don't know yet, Doctor. And I won't know until I test it.", L205186, L205185,m346
 He's making a fine recovery., He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time., L205475, L205474,m346
 Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?, We're pushing oxygen today., L204978, L204977,m346
" I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.", You sound as if you're not looking forward to it., L204980, L204979,m346
" Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.", I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --, L204982, L204981,m346
 That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk..., You may learn to like it., L204984, L204983,m346
 That'll teach you where to keep your hand., Now I know..., L204988, L204987,m346
" That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.", Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter., L204990, L204989,m346
 I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.," I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.", L204992, L204991,m346
" A long time, with one man.", Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --, L204994, L204993,m346

 -- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock., And if it should take more time to get through --, L205106, L205105,m346
 Look at that...they're changing color..., Doctor -- is it possible? That we're seeing it happen before our eyes?, L205145, L205144,m346
 Looks like you didn't batten it down too well., But I did. I'm positive!, L205182, L205181,m346

 You must carry spare parts --, Not anything built into the chassis.  If it hadn't come loose --, L205225, L205224,m346
" If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?"," No, it requires such absolute precision --", L205232, L205231,m346

" Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.", Depends on which end of the telescope you look through., L205354, L205353,m346
 What do you mean?," Well, if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly affect your point of view.", L205356, L205355,m346

 Looks like the molecular structure of proteins., I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample., L205048, L205047,m346
 But that isn't possible., Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!, L205058, L205057,m346
 We can't take a second more., Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it., L205108, L205107,m346
 Nothing miraculous about it. Just an interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of Evolution., You can't believe all that's accidental? That there isn't a Creative Intelligence at work --, L205153, L205152,m346
 What can we do?, Nothing -- against all that force., L205217, L205216,m346
 That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity., Yes..., L205338, L205337,m346
 It's against my better Judgment..., Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?, L205362, L205361,m346
 I've done all I could with the laser., All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!, L205364, L205363,m346
" If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.", Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser., L205366, L205365,m346
" I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!"," As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.", L205368, L205367,m346
 The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.," Take a close look at your Soul, and your Infinity, and your God out there --", L205379, L205378,m346
 --and certain chemicals involving proteins --, You left something out., L205382, L205381,m346

 Removal Point? What're you talking about!," We have no alternative. With only six minutes left, we'll just barely make it.", L205390, L205389,m346
" Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!", I'm going to do what I can to save Benes., L205404, L205403,m346
" The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either.", You mean Inner Space is endless?, L205037, L205036,m346
 Only to the naked eye.  Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life..., Quite a piece of plumbing., L205042, L205041,m346
 I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway..., They all lead to the same place -- the Lungs., L205139, L205138,m346

 Don't tell me they're refueling..., Oxygenation..., L205150, L205149,m346
 Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber -- one of the countless Alvioli of the Lung -- and we can't get enough to fill a microscopic tank.," Maybe we can...  Skipper, is there a snorkel on this sub?", L205172, L205171,m346
 Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?," No, there's no other way.", L205230, L205229,m346
" We'll never get there in time, at this rate.", Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?, L205282, L205281,m346

 You said there was a quick way out!, What about Dr. Michaels?, L205455, L205454,m346
" We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.", At an operation?, L204851, L204850,m346
" They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.", Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --, L204853, L204852,m346
" Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant."," How are you, Miss Peterson?", L204902, L204901,m346
 About forty miles an hour.," Well, it seems to me if you reduce a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we'd take quite a beating.", L204920, L204919,m346
 A what?, A forced joining of an Artery and Vein. Must've happened when Benes was hurt., L205066, L205065,m346
" If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?"," Yes... We can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the Heart.", L205074, L205073,m346
 That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back., I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission., L205078, L205077,m346
 Tell them to take us out., If there's any chance --, L205082, L205081,m346

" At this size, I would certainly think so."," If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  How's that sound to you, Skipper?", L205176, L205175,m346
 In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --," Well, we better get on with it.", L205204, L205203,m346
" Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --", There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub., L205209, L205208,m346

 Grant -- wait a minute -- you're not going to dismantle the wireless?, Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes., L205237, L205236,m346

" Looks like the sea, at dawn."," We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.", L205249, L205248,m346
 Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --, His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area., L205251, L205250,m346
 Sabotage? I don't understand..., I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?, L205254, L205253,m346
 You have no right to blame Duval --, That line was tampered with..., L205256, L205255,m346

 Atomic fuel?, Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside., L204959, L204958,m346
" If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?", They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it., L204961, L204960,m346

So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.

What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.", So?, L281754, L281753,m388
 Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them., If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall., L281756, L281755,m388
 That would mean they'd been trapped in there--, --for three hundred years., L281759, L281758,m388
 How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years., Not unless they're immortal., L281761, L281760,m388
 Would you like to see it?, I've seen it., L281767, L281766,m388

 What now?, Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another., L281821, L281820,m388
 Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt., Where is the film crew from the British Museum?, L281279, L281278,m388
 They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark., Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented., L281281, L281280,m388
 We're holding the workers down below., Why?, L281314, L281313,m388
 Someone broke into the cavern last night., What?  How?, L281316, L281315,m388
 He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside., How could they get by him?, L281319, L281318,m388
 We found him this morning., What's that next to him?, L281322, L281321,m388
 Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication., I don't think it is a duplication., L281326, L281325,m388
 It has to be., And this?, L281328, L281327,m388
 You stayed here again last night?, I was working on the cataloging., L281387, L281386,m388
" Jennifer, there is more to life than work."," I know, Paul.", L281389, L281388,m388
 Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?, I like my work., L281391, L281390,m388
 I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come., We'll see., L281393, L281392,m388
" It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?", It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?, L281195, L281194,m388
 Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?, I do not know -- and even if I did..., L281197, L281196,m388
 Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head., It does not come off as easily as the young ones., L281201, L281200,m388
 Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you., This cannot be., L281634, L281633,m388
" I am stronger than you, Highlander.", That's what the Kurgan said., L281636, L281635,m388
 Fine -- I've waited over three centuries.  I can wait a little longer., Why did you wait?, L281640, L281639,m388
" It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.", It will not end tonight., L281642, L281641,m388
 You know it's not safe here for you., I know., L281214, L281213,m388

 What are you doing?, I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake., L281412, L281411,m388
 Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?, Yes -- when their troubles can harm them., L281414, L281413,m388
 I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?, Fine., L281552, L281551,m388
 What will you do?, There's nothing I can do.  I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon., L281554, L281553,m388
" I could have ended it tonight, but I didn't.", Why?, L281654, L281653,m388
 I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--," You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.", L281656, L281655,m388

 The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim., I gave it to him yesterday., L332946, L332945,m413
 You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.," No, I left it in his office.", L332948, L332947,m413
 Did you see him?, I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files., L332950, L332949,m413
 He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.," He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?", L332952, L332951,m413
" In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all."," Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --", L332955, L332954,m413
 But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.," Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.", L332957, L332956,m413
" When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.", I'll commit that to memory., L332959, L332958,m413
 Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?, Yes., L333233, L333232,m413
 Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?, Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention., L333109, L333108,m413
" Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own."," Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.", L333111, L333110,m413
" It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.", You're just doing your job., L333113, L333112,m413
 It's what I'm paid to do., You're detestable., L333115, L333114,m413
" You wanted to see me, sir."," Sit down, Kafka.", L333086, L333085,m413
" You've been with the firm for nearly nine years.  You've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score.  But there's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving.", ... My ... social situation?, L333088, L333087,m413
" To do my work well, I have little time for --", You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?, L333091, L333090,m413
 I usually take lunch by the River.," It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.", L333093, L333092,m413
 I did not realize it was obligatory.," Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?", L333095, L333094,m413
" No, sir."," Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.", L333097, L333096,m413
" Well, I --"," Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?", L333099, L333098,m413
 -- Eduard --," -- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.", L333101, L333100,m413
 I understand you fancy yourself an author., In a small way., L333106, L333105,m413
" Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.", I do., L333337, L333336,m413
 Was there something else?, No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs., L333341, L333340,m413
" No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.", I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then., L333343, L333342,m413
 The <u>Orlac</u> claim.," Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir.", L333345, L333344,m413
 I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --, I know., L332974, L332973,m413
 You're a friend of Eduard Raban's., Why would you suppose so?, L332976, L332975,m413
" Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --", One of you must be mistaken., L332978, L332977,m413
" I'm sorry, but I just wondered --"," Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.", L332980, L332979,m413
 Hello again., I've never seen you here before., L333020, L333019,m413
 Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office., Yes., L333023, L333022,m413
 I was having an affair with Eduard.  He didn't tell you?, No., L333130, L333129,m413
 He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me., I suspected that he -- well., L333132, L333131,m413
 What?, That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry., L333134, L333133,m413
 What's funny?, This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving., L333137, L333136,m413
 How long were you and Eduard --," Two or three months, that's all.  -- I seduced him.", L333140, L333139,m413
" No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.", Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing., L333143, L333142,m413
" The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?", Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto., L333145, L333144,m413
 He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet., And you believe everything the authorities tell you., L333147, L333146,m413
 When I have no reason to doubt., The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police., L333149, L333148,m413
 Are you free tonight?, Tonight?, L333152, L333151,m413
 There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?, ... All right., L333154, L333153,m413
" You almost married recently, didn't you?", Last year.  I -- it was broken off., L333156, L333155,m413
 Eduard wanted to marry me., And you ...?, L333158, L333157,m413
 -- I don't know the Musil district., You won't have any trouble finding it., L333161, L333160,m413
" Ah -- we're back to the ""authorities"" you spoke of.", They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so., L333169, L333168,m413
 I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work., I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from., L333176, L333175,m413
" The day he died, Eduard was called up to the Castle.  Did you know that?", What of it?, L333185, L333184,m413
 And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered., He was murdered., L333190, L333189,m413
 You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.," I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.", L333195, L333194,m413
" When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression."," People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.", L333197, L333196,m413
 You think what we're doing is so wrong?  And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To answer to some supreme tribunal?, My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?, L333207, L333206,m413
" Yes -- which is why ""quiet, dependable people"" have to take charge of their own lives.", At the cost of others?  You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony.  Did you go to the Castle with Eduard?  Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there., L333209, L333208,m413
" I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.", Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?, L333235, L333234,m413
 Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him., Why were you given notice?, L333237, L333236,m413
 They're not obliged to tell., It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day., L333239, L333238,m413
 Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard., You don't believe that., L333241, L333240,m413
 You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character., Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him., L333246, L333245,m413
 That street down there -- I always used to call it the approach road for suicides.  It leads straight down to the bridge and the River., Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad., L333249, L333248,m413
 Burgel doesn't like anybody!, He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him., L333251, L333250,m413
" Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.", Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?, L333254, L333253,m413
 How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?, I've heard of it happening., L333256, L333255,m413
" And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?", Usually., L333258, L333257,m413
 Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.," First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.", L333260, L333259,m413
 What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that., Now Burgel's one of the authorities?, L333262, L333261,m413
 Gabriela! -- you did get away., I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did., L333497, L333496,m413
 -- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over., Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit., L333499, L333498,m413
 Gabriela ...?, Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.  It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure., L333501, L333500,m413
 Only two steps back?  Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that., I -- I found your jailer., L333504, L333503,m413
 This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment., They're dead now.  We can get help., L333506, L333505,m413
 I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others., There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected., L333508, L333507,m413
 I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.," I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished.", L333510, L333509,m413
 I think you've just escaped for the moment.  Just as I did.  As Eduard did.  As they let us do. But only for the moment., No -- not this time., L333513, L333512,m413
 I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day., -- Listen to me --, L333515, L333514,m413
 Kafka -- is that your real name?," Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?", L333053, L333052,m413
 When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?, Wednesday.  We left the office together., L333055, L333054,m413
 Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?," No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.", L333057, L333056,m413
 Your office is the Workmen's --, -- Accident and Compensation Association., L333059, L333058,m413
 Where you've been employed for seven years., Eight -- and seven months., L333061, L333060,m413
 Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.," Well -- other departments are, yes.", L333063, L333062,m413
 Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?," Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...", L333065, L333064,m413
 He was found in the River.  Could he swim?, I don't know., L333067, L333066,m413
 Was he depressed?, No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?, L333069, L333068,m413
" Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?"," No, I suppose not.", L333071, L333070,m413
" He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.", Can I ask -- how you found me?, L333073, L333072,m413
 His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to., I don't think he really had any. He had no family either., L333075, L333074,m413
" He wasn't a lonely man, though.", What makes you think so?, L333078, L333077,m413
 Probably not.," Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.", L333082, L333081,m413
 I'll bear that in mind., -- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant., L333084, L333083,m413
" But that's just my point -- she was more than upset, she was livid. She slammed every door on her way downstairs -- except that one.  I was just behind her and I didn't even hear that one <u>shut</u> -- not at all.", That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction., L333271, L333270,m413
 You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard., That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add., L333275, L333274,m413
 Maybe it's true then what she said., What did she say?, L333279, L333278,m413
 Do you?, We saw her naked once -- didn't we., L333220, L333219,m413
 I didn't realize you'd been here that long., You mean because it's been a while since there was a sunny day?  What a good detective you are., L333224, L333223,m413
 -- I was just trying to finish some work!, You mean you've actually begun some?, L333373, L333372,m413
 What's the matter with you?, I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it, L333379, L333378,m413
 For all your incompetence I was beginning to think you were at least loyal to me.  You're very good ham actors., -- Just doing our job., L333400, L333399,m413
" Still, we're probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings.", Close only by virtue of antithesis., L333405, L333404,m413
 My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything., It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects., L333407, L333406,m413
 ... Why take me into your confidence?," That's obvious, isn't it?  We have an opening for a new member.", L333174, L333173,m413
 That's <u>mad</u>.," -- Oh, yes, it's mad.", L333309, L333308,m413
" -- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix."," When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...", L333311, L333310,m413
 Why are you so aggressively unimaginative?  Eduard is no longer the only casualty., Then why haven't I been --, L333315, L333314,m413
" -- Gabriela, on the other hand, had made an enemy of this man Burgel."," Oh, Burgel!  Gabriela was having an affair with Eduard.  They were both members of <u>this group</u>.  If any crime's been discovered and people are paying for it, I'd look to <u>yourselves</u>!", L333319, L333318,m413
 ... A piece of paper ...," A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?", L333462, L333461,m413
" Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one.", ... A piece of paper ..., L333464, L333463,m413
 -- You seem amused., It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being., L333467, L333466,m413
 -- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.," ""Accident and Compensation"" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.", L333470, L333469,m413
 I believe we've exceeded his expectations.," I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.", L333472, L333471,m413
 And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in.  You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends.," Yes, well -- we're looking for a new village now.  If we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious.", L333475, L333474,m413
 May I ask where your two warders are?, Lying in the gutter where they belong., L333478, L333477,m413
 The fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you.," On the contrary, it matters a great deal.  We're engaged in immensely important research here.  I'm a revolutionary too, you know -- but a much more pragmatic one.", L333482, L333481,m413
" -- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.", What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?, L333486, L333485,m413
" ""Raban"" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.", It usually is., L333325, L333324,m413
" I'm overworked as it is.  ""Raban"" did you say?", Yes.  Isn't it there?, L333328, L333327,m413
" Wait a minute.  ""Raban?""  Where have I heard that name?", He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department, L333330, L333329,m413
 What's the matter?, Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?, L333332, L333331,m413
 It's gone out so quickly?," Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.", L333334, L333333,m413
 If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?, Orlac is an account?, L333351, L333350,m413
 All these in the last year?," You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!", L333356, L333355,m413
 I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal., Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss., L333358, L333357,m413
 This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?, Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it., L333360, L333359,m413
" Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?", Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?, L333362, L333361,m413
 What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?, These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?, L333364, L333363,m413
 What if I petitioned one of the Directors?," You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.", L333366, L333365,m413
 Where do our records go to in the Castle?," We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.", L333368, L333367,m413
 I could always apply there.," It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle <u>is</u> one of the Directors of this firm.", L333370, L333369,m413
 Ludwig., Oskar., L333121, L333120,m413
 He can't sit still.  Just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one., You look tired., L333217, L333216,m413
 Women are all you have on your mind!, She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing., L333222, L333221,m413
 They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.," We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.", L333226, L333225,m413
 It's not our fault.  We're naturally nervous., And we're upset too., L333377, L333376,m413
 We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa., -- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?, L333382, L333381,m413
 But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult., My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip., L333411, L333410,m413
 Oskar!, Ludwig?, L333493, L333492,m413
 This is filed incorrectly!, Here too!  They're all in a dreadful muddle!, L333495, L333494,m413
 We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk., They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us., L333522, L333521,m413

 Is that...?, The Matrix?  Yeah., L373166, L373165,m433
 Do you always look at it encoded?," Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.

" Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.

 Can you turn off the game?, I'm in the middle of it..., L398647, L398646,m447
 Happy?," No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow.", L398650, L398649,m447
" No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my name.  How could it know?

" She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?", She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware., L410733, L410732,m457
 Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party., Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them., L410742, L410741,m457
 You're hurt..., It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here., L410794, L410793,m457

 Can you get us into Straylight?, Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of., L410671, L410670,m457
 I'm getting used to it. Where are we?, Straylight. Kitchen dock., L410717, L410716,m457
 What the hell is that?, Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon., L410728, L410727,m457
" What you lookin' for, mon?", A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen., L410747, L410746,m457
 Ghost a steppin' razor..., No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close., L410782, L410781,m457
 Easy...," Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.", L410229, L410228,m457
 What's an A.I., An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable., L410234, L410233,m457
" A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?"," He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.", L410476, L410475,m457
 We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.," They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.", L410534, L410533,m457
" The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.", How's the villa's security?, L410542, L410541,m457
 Alright. Let's talk business., Why not?, L410502, L410501,m457
 Those are all your records. I can have you cleared on all counts. Possession. ...Contributing to the delinquency of minors... Statutory rape., I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen., L410509, L410508,m457
" Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer."," You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.", L410517, L410516,m457
 Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you., And how do you suggest I do that?, L410547, L410546,m457
" Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.", You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is., L410159, L410158,m457
" The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.", What does this have to do with me?, L410164, L410163,m457
" Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.", Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf., L410166, L410165,m457
" If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.", My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else., L410169, L410168,m457
 What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?, I'd say you were full of shit., L410171, L410170,m457
 Then I'd ask you what your terms are.," First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.", L410173, L410172,m457
 It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?, We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance., L410175, L410174,m457
" Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?", Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many., L410177, L410176,m457
 I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.," I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.", L410222, L410221,m457
" You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain."," Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.", L410224, L410223,m457

" Why'd you do it, Armitage?", The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I., L410231, L410230,m457
" First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.", This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus., L410236, L410235,m457
 Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct., It hasn't yet., L410238, L410237,m457
" I've heard about rogue A.I.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.", Dixie McCoy, L410240, L410239,m457
 Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know., I've arranged for him to work with us., L410242, L410241,m457
 That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.," I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?", L410244, L410243,m457
 What are you talking about?, Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's., L410246, L410245,m457

 And then?," Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.", L410250, L410249,m457
 You ran without us., I cannot tell a lie. Sorry., L410331, L410330,m457
" Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.", What's he doing to my gear?, L410333, L410332,m457
 What's this?, Could be your A.I.'s calling card., L410338, L410337,m457
 Did you trace it?," No, but it traced me.", L410340, L410339,m457
 Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear., What about McCoy?, L410342, L410341,m457
" He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?", Prepping your trip., L410344, L410343,m457
 Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.," Offworld. The A.I.... this ""Wintermute"" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside.

" Yeah, well it's working.", Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn., L410356, L410355,m457
 Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream., You see the couple up in the balcony?, L410469, L410468,m457
 That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa., He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?, L410471, L410470,m457
 Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier., The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?, L410473, L410472,m457
" That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.", We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night., L410538, L410537,m457
 Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake., Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?, L410594, L410593,m457
" As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.", What are you talking about?, L410596, L410595,m457
 You've got your orders.," This ain't Bangkok, chief.", L410600, L410599,m457
 You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes., I find out now., L410607, L410606,m457
" An odd selection, Mr Case.", I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest., L410695, L410694,m457
 Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil., Can you read my mind?, L410697, L410696,m457
" You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote ""Wintermute"".", Are you even really alive?, L410702, L410701,m457
 Tell me the words., The words?, L410706, L410705,m457
 The access code to your mainframe.," Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.", L410708, L410707,m457
" What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?"," Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.", L410710, L410709,m457
 Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.," It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.", L410712, L410711,m457
" Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?"," Fine, Ratz. Thanks.", L410095, L410094,m457

" Hey, bro.", It's Case. Remember me?, L410294, L410293,m457
" Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?"," Fine, Dixie. Fine.", L410296, L410295,m457
 Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it., Yeah. That was me., L410298, L410297,m457
" Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura."," As far as they know, that's absolutely true.", L410300, L410299,m457
" Ya learned good. So, what's happening?", That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?, L410302, L410301,m457
 Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...," Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?", L410304, L410303,m457
" Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct."," Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.", L410306, L410305,m457
 What elders?, Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside., L410572, L410571,m457
 She's ready to go.," Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.", L410610, L410609,m457

 Ready?," I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.", L410895, L410894,m457
 Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?," Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.", L410901, L410900,m457
" Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.", Jah guides us., L410905, L410904,m457
 What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?, Right..., L410312, L410311,m457
 I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine., You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special., L410314, L410313,m457
" Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?", What?, L410316, L410315,m457

 Who got you into this?, A guy who calls himself Armitage., L410375, L410374,m457
 Never heard of him., Nobody has., L410377, L410376,m457
 I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?," No problem, amigo.", L410379, L410378,m457
" What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it."," Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.", L410381, L410380,m457

 Bright enough to be dangerous., That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe., L410553, L410552,m457
" He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.", Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him., L410555, L410554,m457
 It's possible. The guy was a blank slate., So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense., L410557, L410556,m457
 Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs., No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful., L410559, L410558,m457
" Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it."," The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?", L410561, L410560,m457

" Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?", We run. You crack the pattern?, L410678, L410677,m457
" Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.", You can make your move when it comes after me., L410680, L410679,m457
 What are you talkin' about?, I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix., L410682, L410681,m457
 It'll flatline your ass., Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?, L410685, L410684,m457

 Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.," How long, Dixie?", L410772, L410771,m457
 Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.," Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.", L410774, L410773,m457

 What about the route to the core?, I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive., L410858, L410857,m457
" You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...", Case., L410497, L410496,m457
 What about the mainframe's access code?, 3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code., L410545, L410544,m457
 Wait... You hear that?, What?, L410806, L410805,m457

" Why did you come here tonight, Linda?", People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you., L410110, L410109,m457
 I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me., This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score., L410112, L410111,m457
 Where did you here that?," Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.", L410114, L410113,m457
 Case... are you okay?, I don't know. I don't know..., L410877, L410876,m457
 I know who you are.," There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.", L410439, L410438,m457
 And we really do have to talk., You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed., L410441, L410440,m457
 I had to limit your options., And Linda..., L410443, L410442,m457
 You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.," I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.", L410445, L410444,m457

 His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you., Why should I want to meet him., L410142, L410141,m457

" He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?", Couple of months., L410183, L410182,m457

 Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant., Sustained.  Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature., L443522, L443521,m473
 Objection!, Sustained., L443528, L443527,m473
" Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.", Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned., L443539, L443538,m473
" Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?"," I admit, I know nothing of your culture.", L443475, L443474,m473
 Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.," Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.", L443477, L443476,m473
" Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?", Show this to the President., L443479, L443478,m473
" Good morning, Dr. Zira."," Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?", L443251, L443250,m473
" You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.", Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame., L443256, L443255,m473
" Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?", See? He keeps pretending he can talk., L443261, L443260,m473
 Did you see that? It's remarkable!, Huh?, L443264, L443263,m473
 He's trying to form words.," Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.", L443266, L443265,m473
 What happened?, Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?, L443323, L443322,m473
 Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.," He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.", L443330, L443329,m473
 Landon! Send a last signal., What signal?, L443117, L443116,m473
 It's no use ... there she goes., Forget it. Abandon ship., L443123, L443122,m473
 Gone., We're here to stay., L443128, L443127,m473
" Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?", We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix., L443130, L443129,m473
 Landon! Join the expedition., Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?, L443144, L443143,m473
 Air leak. Died in her sleep., You don't seem very cut up about it., L443146, L443145,m473
 It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year., Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months., L443148, L443147,m473
" Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?", long pause) You know it., L443151, L443150,m473
 Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.," Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.", L443153, L443152,m473
 If only we could get a fix., What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are., L443170, L443169,m473
 All right --," There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.", L443174, L443173,m473
 Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing," Climb off me, will you!", L443178, L443177,m473
" And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.", Taylor., L443180, L443179,m473
 Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?, Don't bother, L443183, L443182,m473
 Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative., But I'm not prepared to die., L443185, L443184,m473
 Scarecrows?, Let's take a look., L443197, L443196,m473
 Can we take a dip?, Okay., L443201, L443200,m473
 No cigar., Try telling them our names., L443209, L443208,m473
 We got off at the wrong stop.," You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.", L443220, L443219,m473
 Who are you?, So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --, L443578, L443577,m473
 She comes along too., Zira doesn't want your female., L443582, L443581,m473
 I want her., If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --, L443584, L443583,m473
 Shouldn't we be moving on?, I'm for that., L443653, L443652,m473
 Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?, In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair., L443659, L443658,m473
" Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.", Always giving orders. Just like every other adult., L443693, L443692,m473
" Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel, Lucius?", Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --, L443734, L443733,m473
" All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.", What is it?, L443736, L443735,m473
 I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.," Yes, I can do that.", L443738, L443737,m473
 They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?, I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose., L443762, L443761,m473
 Lucius., I think you're making a mistake., L443780, L443779,m473
 That's the boy. Keep 'em flying., What?, L443782, L443781,m473
 I told you not to bring the other one., He wouldn't leave her., L443587, L443586,m473
 Gorilla hunters ..., Keep moving. We can't turn back now., L443592, L443591,m473
 Who put them up?, The Hunt Club., L443639, L443638,m473
 What is that?," A man, Dr. Maximus.", L443379, L443378,m473
" Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.", Why special?, L443382, L443381,m473
 You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here., My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation., L443444, L443443,m473
" And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him."," At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.", L443446, L443445,m473
 Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down., My name is Taylor., L443459, L443458,m473
 It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself., This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story..., L443461, L443460,m473
 One is in a museum!, Dr. Zira! Silence that man!, L443494, L443493,m473
" You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!", Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!, L443514, L443513,m473
" Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius."," By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.", L443442, L443441,m473
" Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.", Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something., L443454, L443453,m473
 That╒s a lie!," Mind your tongue, madame.", L443470, L443469,m473
" Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.", Read it yourself., L443481, L443480,m473
" 'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained...""", Stop right there. Bring me that paper., L443483, L443482,m473
 This is a joke in very poor taste., Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?, L443485, L443484,m473
 How so?," Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.", L443526, L443525,m473
 Sustained.," Sustain all objections, but face the truth!", L443532, L443531,m473
 Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?, With one of them., L443504, L443503,m473
 What about me?," Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?", L443543, L443542,m473
 No.," Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.", L443545, L443544,m473
" However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.", I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours., L443547, L443546,m473
 You lied. Where is your tribe?," My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.", L443549, L443548,m473
" Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?", What about it?, L443551, L443550,m473
" A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?", I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira., L443553, L443552,m473
 Certainly not.," That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.", L443555, L443554,m473
 Of course.," All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?", L443557, L443556,m473
 Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --, Then you admit --, L443559, L443558,m473
" I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?"," Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?", L443561, L443560,m473
" You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?", I don't know., L443563, L443562,m473
" If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.", I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?, L443565, L443564,m473
 Stop right there., Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned., L443667, L443666,m473
 There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.," All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.", L443683, L443682,m473
 What is your proposal?, When were the Sacred Scrolls written?, L443687, L443686,m473
 Twelve hundred years ago., Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history, L443689, L443688,m473
 Of course., Okay.Up to the cave., L443691, L443690,m473
" I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you."," That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof.", L443723, L443722,m473
 Tell him to pull back!, Cease fire! Withdraw!, L443729, L443728,m473
" Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?"," He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.", L443753, L443752,m473
 Then there is another jungle?," Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.", L443766, L443765,m473
 Sure.," Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?", L443768, L443767,m473
" Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?"," Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.", L443786, L443785,m473
 What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.," The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.", L443788, L443787,m473
 We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.," Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.", L443790, L443789,m473
" Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?"," Listen, listen -- I can speak --", L443259, L443258,m473
 Speak! Go on., My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!, L443277, L443276,m473
 I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?," Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!", L443281, L443280,m473
 Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?, Shhhh!, L443434, L443433,m473
 What is this?, A hearing., L443436, L443435,m473
 It's him...Landon., Which one?, L443501, L443500,m473
 You! ... You knew about this?," No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.", L443509, L443508,m473
 Listen-, Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes., L443590, L443589,m473
" Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.", You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?, L443619, L443618,m473
 Are you going to take her with you?, Yes., L443633, L443632,m473
" Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.", Maybe not., L443635, L443634,m473
 You want her that much?," You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.", L443637, L443636,m473
" What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?", She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant., L443655, L443654,m473
 And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.," Taylor, please --", L443680, L443679,m473
 Taylor! Tell him., He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls., L443710, L443709,m473
 Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.," Taylor, you can't.", L443742, L443741,m473
" Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.", Why not?, L443747, L443746,m473
 It's humiliating., Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?, L443749, L443748,m473
 Would you like to come along?, We can't., L443771, L443770,m473
" Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye."," All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!", L443776, L443775,m473
" Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.", God bless you., L443778, L443777,m473
 He's moving his fingers!, Of course. He saw you moving yours., L443287, L443286,m473
 Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?," Yes, Sir.", L443385, L443384,m473
 Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.," I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.", L443487, L443486,m473
 Do you believe him?," Like you, I find it difficult.", L443489, L443488,m473
 But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture., This is his assertion., L443491, L443490,m473
" How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?", He doesn't know., L443496, L443495,m473
" Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.", Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity., L443524, L443523,m473
" Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?"," But there's the doll, sir.", L443705, L443704,m473
 But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?," He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.", L443764, L443763,m473
 But the proof? The doll?, In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry., L443799, L443798,m473
" Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.  Then a different set of track, over there.", What do you mean?, L450131, L450130,m478
" Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.", I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush., L450148, L450147,m478
" I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.", What about the rest of Hopper's men?, L450150, L450149,m478

" You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?"," No way, old buddy.", L450091, L450090,m478

So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.", L450097, L450096,m478

 Mean anything to you?, Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time., L450134, L450133,m478
" I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?", Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here., L450142, L450141,m478
" It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work."," That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.", L450180, L450179,m478
 Why us?," Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.", L450182, L450181,m478
 What story did you give to Davis?," We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?", L450184, L450183,m478
 She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.," We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.", L450198, L450197,m478

" Oh my God, what is he doing?", He's shutting off the air!!!, L525716, L525715,m526
 Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!, I'll tell you what I'm going to do., L525756, L525755,m526
 Getting drunk is no solution.," Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.", L525778, L525777,m526
 I think we're moving., Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about., L525818, L525817,m526
 I never though I'd be stuck in a wine closet with Warren Wayne.," Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.", L525820, L525819,m526
" Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...", Oh yeah..., L525874, L525873,m526
 Oh yeah..., Oh Sara..., L525876, L525875,m526
 Anna..., Anna..., L525878, L525877,m526
" Jesus, come on!", They're not going to make it!, L525956, L525955,m526
 Evening., It can't be., L525350, L525349,m526
 Excuse me?, You're Warren Wayne., L525352, L525351,m526
" Uh, yes I am.  And you are?"," Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -", L525354, L525353,m526
" Koros, as in...Koros?  Dimitri Koros?"," My grandfather.  My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.", L525356, L525355,m526
" Oh, thank you."," Magnificent, magnificent.", L525358, L525357,m526
 Well I appreciate that.," So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?", L525360, L525359,m526
" Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance."," Of course, of course...", L525362, L525361,m526
 So..., Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip., L525364, L525363,m526
" Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?", It certainly is., L525366, L525365,m526
" Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.", I'm sure I will., L525368, L525367,m526
" No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.", Very professional of you., L525435, L525434,m526
 Where the hell did you come from?, Hello second mate Barnes. I was instructed to come to the bridge., L525671, L525670,m526
 Weren't you down in the dining room?, I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly., L525680, L525679,m526
 Yes he did.  Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -," You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?", L525683, L525682,m526
" And what are they doing now, Mac?", They are awaiting further information., L525686, L525685,m526
 Were you going to give it to them?, I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this., L525688, L525687,m526
 On channel 10?, The device has stopped responding., L525692, L525691,m526
" Mac, you really earned your wings this flight.", My...wings..., L525708, L525707,m526
 I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this., I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one., L525711, L525710,m526
 There is a high level...of passenger , And I intend to correct that at once. I'll tell you something Mac..., L525713, L525712,m526
" Why should she, it's her fault. All guests are told not to eat in zero gravity, but she just wanted to have fun I guess, didn't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery."," Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.", L525337, L525336,m526
 What did you say to me?, It's a little late for you to be up., L525478, L525477,m526
" All too well, captain.", Well shut it off at once!, L525485, L525484,m526
" Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.", Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much., L525342, L525341,m526
" No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?", Well it's a good thing that I did., L525377, L525376,m526
 It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?, There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?, L525379, L525378,m526
 Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands., Why don't you reset and run it again.  The pods check out ok., L525381, L525380,m526
 You're certain of that?, Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes., L525383, L525382,m526
" Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.", Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -, L525445, L525444,m526
" So, are you on for the next one?"," I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.", L525447, L525446,m526
" Why, didn't they say?"," Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.", L525449, L525448,m526
 You want to go back to shuttle work?," It's steady, good benefits.", L525451, L525450,m526
 You gotta think of your old age.," That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.", L525453, L525452,m526
" Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?."," Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?", L525456, L525455,m526
" What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?", Uh..., L525458, L525457,m526
 I think I can handle it.," Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?", L525460, L525459,m526
 No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.," Well, maybe I'll surprise you.", L525462, L525461,m526
 Bridge!  Can anyone hear me?!," Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.", L525495, L525494,m526
 If anyone can hear me please respond!," That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.", L525498, L525497,m526
" Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?"," Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.", L525501, L525500,m526
" The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?"," Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!", L525504, L525503,m526
" Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.", What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -, L525506, L525505,m526
 Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?, You better start making sense!, L525512, L525511,m526
" Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.", Then we've got to get to the lifepods!, L525514, L525513,m526
 It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!," Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?", L525532, L525531,m526
" Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.", We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?, L525604, L525603,m526
" That was a joke Taylor, lighten up!  Why don't you just hold them up to the lens.  I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you.", Will you transmit the distress signal?, L525607, L525606,m526
" Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?"," Taylor, you surprise me.", L525695, L525694,m526
 I don't know what you're talking about!, Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?, L525698, L525697,m526
 Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!," I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?", L525700, L525699,m526
 Idiot..., Good help is hard to find..., L525897, L525896,m526
 Barnes?, That's me., L525585, L525584,m526
" Break it down to me, what's going on?", Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon., L525587, L525586,m526
 Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.," Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.", L525589, L525588,m526
 Will do.  What about the distress signal?, I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave., L525591, L525590,m526
 Well that's your call.  Doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me.  Just as long as I get my cut.," Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.", L525593, L525592,m526
 It's time we lock coordinates.," I know, I know.", L525806, L525805,m526
" So, what are we waiting for?", Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control., L525808, L525807,m526
" You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes!  Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?"," The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!", L525859, L525858,m526
 This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!," Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!", L525861, L525860,m526
 Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?," I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!", L525883, L525882,m526
 Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!," Let's get something straight, Chappy!", L525885, L525884,m526
 Now I got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod!  You're just gonna have to pick me up later.," This is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!", L525888, L525887,m526
 Is that clear?, That's clear., L525892, L525891,m526
 Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me., Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!, L525894, L525893,m526
 Look at this...Jesus.," Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.", L525404, L525403,m526
 No.  But it buys a lot of other things., Like that piece of ass he was with., L525406, L525405,m526
" Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.", Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off., L525408, L525407,m526
" Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here."," I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.", L525410, L525409,m526
 What's the use...we're gonna die..., Don't say that!  It ain't over till it's over!, L525726, L525725,m526
 We're going to die., Will you shut up already?, L525748, L525747,m526
 It's getting hard to breathe..., Just don't move around too much., L525864, L525863,m526
" Oh right, right you're on that research grant.", That's right., L525388, L525387,m526
" Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?"," Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?", L525390, L525389,m526
 So you were looking for a new challenge.," Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime?", L525393, L525392,m526
" Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.", Like open an airlock by mistake?, L525395, L525394,m526
 Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher., Well I hope I don't do anything careless., L525397, L525396,m526
 I'm sure you'll be all right.," Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.", L525399, L525398,m526
 Really?," Still, I hope I behave on the moon.  I'll stick close to you.", L525401, L525400,m526
 What are we going to do?, I don't know., L525538, L525537,m526
 We don't., Well maybe there's a way out of here., L525542, L525541,m526
" Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team get you out if the doors won't open?", Probably come through the wall I suppose., L525545, L525544,m526
" I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?", Just considering our options... sir., L525548, L525547,m526
 Supposing we could get out of this room?  Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?, It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry., L525577, L525576,m526
 Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?, With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me., L525579, L525578,m526
 OK...it's open., Seen one like it before?, L525611, L525610,m526
 Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes., Great., L525613, L525612,m526
 Damn it.  If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something -, Why can't we?, L525644, L525643,m526
 And suppose you couldn't hold out?, Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?, L525648, L525647,m526
" We could send Mac.  If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other.", You're right., L525650, L525649,m526
 He certainly is polite., Close every door behind you!, L525656, L525655,m526
 It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.," Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.", L525662, L525661,m526
 If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.," Even if we do, it might be too late.", L525731, L525730,m526
 Everyone just stay put., Wait., L525736, L525735,m526
 I can't let you do that., Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking., L525739, L525738,m526
 I don't know what we're facing., I understand., L525761, L525760,m526
 Are you ready?, Ready as I'll ever be., L525763, L525762,m526
 Yeah.  We did it., So we did., L525767, L525766,m526
 You're ready for the real thing?, At this point I'm ready for anything., L525770, L525769,m526
" Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.", Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?, L525786, L525785,m526
 Explosive?," One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...", L525790, L525789,m526
 Taylor?, Yeah?, L525794, L525793,m526
" Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature."," Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.", L525797, L525796,m526
 Do you want some advice?, Sure., L525799, L525798,m526
" Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.", Words to live by., L525801, L525800,m526
 Dawn!  Dawn!, Helllp!, L525815, L525814,m526
 I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.  You saved my life.," It was no time to lose my partner. We're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.", L525826, L525825,m526
 Oh my God.  What happened?, The room is filled with poison gas.  The hydraulic system must have blown., L525828, L525827,m526
 What's that?, A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods., L525831, L525830,m526
 We don't have enough suits to get the others out.," That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.", L525833, L525832,m526
 Take this flare., A flare?  A flare won't do it., L525837, L525836,m526
" A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?", Why?  Where are you going?, L525842, L525841,m526
 I'm not going with you., What?  What are you talking about?, L525844, L525843,m526
 And what are you going to do?!, I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here., L525847, L525846,m526
 But how are you going to escape?, Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal., L525849, L525848,m526
 But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!, I can't!, L525851, L525850,m526
 I will once I get past the bulkhead.  Good luck., You too., L525857, L525856,m526
 Dawn.  Come in., Taylor!  Where are you?, L525900, L525899,m526
 I'm in the bridge., Barnes?, L525902, L525901,m526
 He's out of the equation.  Talk to me., I'm about to blow the wall., L525904, L525903,m526
 Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!, How does the distress signal look?, L525906, L525905,m526
" Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.", I'll do my best., L525908, L525907,m526
 So what's going to happen to you?, I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry., L525910, L525909,m526
" Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?", Hopefully sooner than later., L525912, L525911,m526
 Sooner than later., Over and out., L525914, L525913,m526
 What the hell are you doing?, We have room!  Let's go!, L525950, L525949,m526
 What do you mean?  What happened!," We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!", L525952, L525951,m526
 So close..., And so far., L525962, L525961,m526
" I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.", It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that., L525975, L525974,m526
 Will you marry me?, Marry you?, L525979, L525978,m526
" I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter.", It would matter to us., L525982, L525981,m526
" In that case, I accept."," Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.", L525984, L525983,m526
" Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.  People are going to work, kids are going to school...", Try not to think about it., L525990, L525989,m526
 What is it?!, I don't know.  Wave to them!, L525994, L525993,m526
 I'm fine., Congratulations on your...recent award., L525304, L525303,m526
 Thank you., Is there anything I can help you with?, L525306, L525305,m526
" No, just enjoying the view."," Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.", L525308, L525307,m526
 So I've been told.," Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.", L525310, L525309,m526
" Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.", That is one of my priorities., L525626, L525625,m526
 What is happening around here!!!, There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!, L525921, L525920,m526
 Where's Taylor?, He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?, L525923, L525922,m526
 Carlo!, He's in the bathroom., L525927, L525926,m526
 I'm going back for Taylor!, Are you nuts!  It's too risky!, L525943, L525942,m526
 I'm homesick., Homesick?  It's only been two days!, L525324, L525323,m526
" We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach."," Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.", L525326, L525325,m526
 How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?," Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.", L525328, L525327,m526
" Look around you baby, we're rubbing elbows with royalty, oil sheiks, this is class.  You'll be envied by everyone.", I guess so., L525330, L525329,m526
 Oh no...I think there's carrots in here..., Send it back if you don't want it., L525419, L525418,m526
 Well now what are we gonna do!, How am I supposed to know?, L525555, L525554,m526

 How's that?," Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.", L528072, L528071,m528

 They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them., We can refuse to talk., L528062, L528061,m528
 When did it come across?, Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now., L527259, L527258,m528
 Where's it coming from?, No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater., L527261, L527260,m528
 Is it coming from our own computer?," Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.", L527263, L527262,m528

 This answers one of our questions., Which one?  Let me get the list out., L527078, L527077,m528
" This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home."," But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.", L527080, L527079,m528
 I mentioned it in my report.  Didn't you read the report?," Everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human.  If it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding.", L527099, L527098,m528
 And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.," Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.", L527112, L527111,m528
" Don't be so optomistic, Harry.", I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?, L527123, L527122,m528
 Not a clue., A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible., L527125, L527124,m528
 I don't follow you.," On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an ""Unknown Entry Event."" They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.", L527127, L527126,m528
" So, <u>we know</u>.  We know it went through a black hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report like some big discovery.  So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole.  <u>But they didn't</u>.  The called it an Unknown Entry Event.", Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone., L527130, L527129,m528
" I can't believe that, Harry.", Gimme another explanation., L527133, L527132,m528
" I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.", Am I?, L527135, L527134,m528
" Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight."," You mean, you think I'm cracking?", L527137, L527136,m528
 No.  I didn't say that.," Then what, Norman?", L527139, L527138,m528
" It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you."," Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.", L527141, L527140,m528
 What is that?  That noise?, What noise?, L527229, L527228,m528
" Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?", What are you still doing here?, L527232, L527231,m528
 You remember opening the door?, You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here., L527234, L527233,m528
 Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?, You don't understand about the sphere., L527236, L527235,m528
 Norman?," What is it, Harry?", L527239, L527238,m528
 What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?," Page 87 of what, Harry?", L527241, L527240,m528
 I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.," That far in what, Harry?", L527243, L527242,m528
" These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.", What are they?, L527255, L527254,m528
 Getting anywhere with those?, There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute., L527265, L527264,m528
" Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?", Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish., L527267, L527266,m528
" You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.", Did I?, L527269, L527268,m528
 You don't remember that?," I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine.  Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others.  It's normal, really, isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress. The panic.", L527271, L527270,m528
 ... you there?  Norman?, Harry?, L527658, L527657,m528
" Norman, where are you?", I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?, L527660, L527659,m528
 Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --, What happened to her?, L527664, L527663,m528
 What do you mean?  She's not here?," When I woke up, nobody was here.", L527666, L527665,m528
 She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me., Her suit's gone., L527668, L527667,m528
 Beth left?, I thought she was with you., L527670, L527669,m528
" She's cracking, Norman.", You didn't say that about the food?, L527683, L527682,m528
" I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.", But why would she -- ?, L527685, L527684,m528
 Wisconsin's your answer., Wisconsin?, L527751, L527750,m528

 That's right., Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag?, L527771, L527770,m528
 What is it?," You know what it is, Harry.", L527821, L527820,m528
 It's the squid!  Stop it!, Stop what?  What are you -- ?, L527823, L527822,m528
 Did I kill her?, I don't think so., L527995, L527994,m528
 Fine., Help me lift her., L528002, L528001,m528
 We're never gonna make it., Shut up and open the door., L528004, L528003,m528
 How much time you figure to get to the surface?, Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub., L528006, L528005,m528
 I can't reach her., Hold on., L528014, L528013,m528

" How's that working out, by the way?", Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means., L528054, L528053,m528
 There is one possibility.," We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.", L528065, L528064,m528
" The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?", You mean forget?, L528067, L528066,m528
 What'd you say to him?, To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know., L526912, L526911,m528
 What does Norman already know?, Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake., L526914, L526913,m528

 English?, That's right., L527016, L527015,m528
 You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious., Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?, L527020, L527019,m528
 A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again., But it's impossible., L527022, L527021,m528
 Why would this ship carry instructions in English?, Think about it., L527025, L527024,m528

" We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.

 Meaning it didn't land in the water., Please.  It must have flown here --, L527046, L527045,m528

" Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up.

Both of you will have to learn..., L542219, L542218,m529
 We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.," All right then, we'll use your plan.", L542221, L542220,m529
 I'll get the information., ... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments., L542223, L542222,m529
 Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal., Is that good or bad?, L542250, L542249,m529

 I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper., I know that., L542023, L542022,m529
 You saw through me?, You could put it that way., L542025, L542024,m529
 I assure you my intentions weren't bad.," I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?", L542027, L542026,m529
 I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing., But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it., L542031, L542030,m529
" I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.

 You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me., My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was..., L542040, L542039,m529
" Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.", You mean I generate an energy field?, L542042, L542041,m529
 It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!, Could I learn to feel it?, L542044, L542043,m529

 Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful., Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?, L542058, L542057,m529

" When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?", I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there., L542136, L542135,m529

 Are you sure you don't need it?, I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on., L542155, L542154,m529
 What do I do?," All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ...

" The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.

 I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless., Did it occur to you they might find us?, L542411, L542410,m529

 You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them..., Why?, L542179, L542178,m529
 Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.," All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.", L542188, L542187,m529
" No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!", Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try., L542195, L542194,m529

 Who is...'V'ger'...?, V'ger is that which programmed me., L544948, L544947,m531
 Where is Lt. Ilia?, That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise., L544952, L544951,m531
 Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?, V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator., L544955, L544954,m531
 Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?, To join with him., L544957, L544956,m531
 The Creator is that which created V'ger., Who is V'ger?, L544962, L544961,m531
 The examination is a normal function., You may proceede., L544968, L544967,m531
 <U>Why</U>...?!, The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet., L545120, L545119,m531
 <U>Why</U>?!, The Creator has not answered., L545122, L545121,m531
 The carbon-units are not responsible for that., You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner., L545124, L545123,m531
 Disclose the information., Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet., L545137, L545136,m531
" Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?", Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet., L545150, L545149,m531
 They have repressed the Creator., The information will not be disclosed., L545152, L545151,m531
 Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices., V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information., L545155, L545154,m531
 Our data is being prepared., <U>Answer</U>!, L545226, L545225,m531
 The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?, Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?, L545002, L545001,m531
 Yes., Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement., L545004, L545003,m531
 What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?, Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units., L545006, L545005,m531
 Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units., More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage., L545008, L545007,m531
 What does that mean?," When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.", L545010, L545009,m531
 Within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit. If I can help you revive these patterns, That is logical. You may procede., L545012, L545011,m531
 Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?, The carbon units are of no consequence, L545035, L545034,m531
 You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator., That is how V'ger will survive., L545038, L545037,m531
 A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?, By the Creator., L545091, L545090,m531
" To join, and become One with the Creator?", To learn all that is learnable, L545093, L545092,m531

 'To learn all that is learnable.'," It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.", L545108, L545107,m531

 Yes., May I ask Why?, L544594, L544593,m531
" My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew..."," Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.", L544596, L544595,m531
" That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will."," No, Admiral. I don't think you are", L544599, L544598,m531
" We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible..."," None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.", L544617, L544616,m531
 Programming ready?," Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...", L544690, L544689,m531
 ... but I still recommend further simulation study., Mister Decker, L544692, L544691,m531
" Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?"," Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.", L544738, L544737,m531
" Then you acted properly, of course."," Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.", L544740, L544739,m531
 You saved the ship.," I'm aware of that, sir.", L544742, L544741,m531
" Stop competing with me, Decker!"," Permission to speak freely, sir?", L544744, L544743,m531
 Granted.," Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.", L544746, L544745,m531
" I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?"," Yes, sir, I'll do that.", L544748, L544747,m531
 If our Executive Officer has no objections...?, Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications., L544773, L544772,m531
" Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields."," No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?", L544815, L544814,m531
" Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?", Mr Decker...., L544819, L544818,m531
" I advise caution, Captain", That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet., L544865, L544864,m531
" That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble."," How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!", L544867, L544866,m531

 The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!," Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!", L544909, L544908,m531
 Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us," They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.", L544923, L544922,m531
" Captain, what's the next move?"," The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...", L545163, L545162,m531
" Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called."," I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.", L545167, L545166,m531
"     , if we do not provide     V'ger with certain information, we won't have twenty-two <U>seconds</U>"," Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.", L545208, L545207,m531
 Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately., Captain... I'd like to go along..., L545221, L545220,m531
" The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal."," Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...", L545251, L545250,m531
" And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback."," Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!", L545253, L545252,m531

 We could have cut it off at the main computer..., This served the purpose., L544903, L544902,m531

" Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.", That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!, L544980, L544979,m531
 Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too., It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image., L545126, L545125,m531
" Forward motion, Captain...!", A tractor beam..., L545161, L545160,m531
" Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need to fulfill itself?"," V'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. To fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension", L545193, L545192,m531

 A little., Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place., L556321, L556320,m540
" Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.", I did., L556352, L556351,m540
 Finished your estimate?," Well, there's several ways to go .", L555865, L555864,m540
 You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around., I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service., L555868, L555867,m540
 I bet they do., What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire., L555870, L555869,m540
 What is it?, A passionfruit smoothee., L555879, L555878,m540
 To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together., I'll drink to that., L555882, L555881,m540
" Oh no, not you again.", What an adorable hat., L556010, L556009,m540
 They think I have a concussion., And you think you're in love., L556012, L556011,m540
 I know it.," This ""love"" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.", L556014, L556013,m540
 Why should I believe you?, It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl., L556016, L556015,m540
" Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?"," But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.", L556019, L556018,m540
 Nurse! Nurse!, You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am., L556023, L556022,m540

" This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.", I don't want your help., L556034, L556033,m540
 No!, I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!, L556037, L556036,m540
" I'm wise to your tricks, lady.", I could force you., L556237, L556236,m540
" If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again."," Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.", L556239, L556238,m540

 They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?, Yeah., L556299, L556298,m540

" You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?", Well...I guess I can't., L556362, L556361,m540
 Why the empty cage?," That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.", L556366, L556365,m540
" You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.", Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants., L555713, L555712,m540
" Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you."," Why George, are you proposing?", L555715, L555714,m540

" Hey, where you going?", I've got things to do., L555722, L555721,m540
 What about my proposal?, Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch., L555724, L555723,m540
 Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business., Nice to meet you., L555990, L555989,m540
 Do you have any theories about last night?, Theories?, L555994, L555993,m540
 I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is., Can I quote you?, L555999, L555998,m540
" Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?"," He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.", L556006, L556005,m540

" Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?"," Oh, sure.", L556001, L556000,m540
 I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!, How do you know?, L556306, L556305,m540
 I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building., Did anybody notice you?, L556308, L556307,m540
 I can't help it if men notice me., Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!, L556310, L556309,m540
 I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute., I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us., L556313, L556312,m540
 I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens., Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention., L556372, L556371,m540

 Why didn't you tell me?, You're supposed to guess., L556376, L556375,m540
 I am almost an adult. This is what I want.," But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.", L555728, L555727,m540
 It was my fault we lost the Power Source., Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it., L555730, L555729,m540
 Superman will return it.," Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-", L555735, L555734,m540

 What are you making:," It's going to be a tree, I think.", L555674, L555673,m540
 What's a tree?," It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.", L555676, L555675,m540
 Where is Earth?, Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?, L555678, L555677,m540
 Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space., I don't understand., L555681, L555680,m540
" You see, a tree is a living thing.", Can you create life?, L555685, L555684,m540
 I'm sorry... I didn't know., It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you., L555705, L555704,m540
 I can do that., No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?, L555798, L555797,m540

" I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...", Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?, L555802, L555801,m540
 I'd rather not talk about it., You're not...an orphan are you?, L555804, L555803,m540
 My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.," Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.", L555806, L555805,m540
 She did that deliberately., She's a beast., L555810, L555809,m540
 How'd you do that?, Must've been a defective puck., L555812, L555811,m540
 Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you., But what for?, L555814, L555813,m540
 Your hair looks the same., It was just a trim., L555846, L555845,m540
 No thanks. You go on., You sure?, L555852, L555851,m540
 Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...," Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.", L555910, L555909,m540
" Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.", It doesn't seem right., L555912, L555911,m540

 I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car., Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D., L555992, L555991,m540
" Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.", He's nice., L556003, L556002,m540
 You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?, I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers., L556048, L556047,m540
 Don't you believe in knocking?," Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.", L555783, L555782,m540
 What can I do for you?, I'm Linda Lee., L555785, L555784,m540
" I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.", Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here., L555789, L555788,m540
" No plans for the weekend, Linda?"," No, MR. Danvers.", L555858, L555857,m540
 Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?, I'd love to., L555860, L555859,m540
" Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.", What? Me?, L555902, L555901,m540
" Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.", It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me., L555755, L555754,m540
 I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.," You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.", L555757, L555756,m540
 I just did. Because I have the Power., You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over., L555759, L555758,m540
" Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.", Cigarette?, L555761, L555760,m540

" Balefire on you, Selena!", You Scorpios can never take a joke., L555768, L555767,m540
 You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning., Throw him out., L555770, L555769,m540
" Nigel, get lost.", I have to talk to you., L555889, L555888,m540
 You're wasting your breath., You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft., L555891, L555890,m540
" ...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?"," I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.", L555894, L555893,m540
 Nothing's wrong with my skin., Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself., L555896, L555895,m540
" You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.", We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft., L556161, L556160,m540
 Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?, You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power., L556173, L556172,m540
" Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?", Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart., L556175, L556174,m540
 That was meant for me!, Thank you. I'm going to close this up again., L555927, L555926,m540
 Who are you ?, I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry., L556126, L556125,m540
 That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while., A cheap trick., L556131, L556130,m540
 The Danvers. And two of your little friends., It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for., L556399, L556398,m540
" You've run out of things to throw, Selena.", Not yet., L556403, L556402,m540
 I'm free. I can never thank you enough., For what?, L556422, L556421,m540
 Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time., Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you., L556424, L556423,m540
 What's it like?, It's the most beautiful place in the universe., L556431, L556430,m540
 Where is inner space?, It's everywhere. But water is always the door., L556435, L556434,m540

 I was on Earth..., Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?, L556271, L556270,m540
 Shouldnt've done that.," ...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.", L556274, L556273,m540
 It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---, I know., L556276, L556275,m540
 Others?, Criminals., L556279, L556278,m540
" ...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam...""", What? Palace? Hardly., L556282, L556281,m540
 It's lovely. . .," No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.", L556286, L556285,m540
" Are you happy, Zaltar?", What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time., L556288, L556287,m540
 You look at them? How?, The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools., L556292, L556291,m540
 That horrible woman!, Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad., L556303, L556302,m540
" Zaltar, please help me."," Of course, my dear. What can I do?", L556326, L556325,m540
 There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.," If there's a way in, there must be a way out.", L556329, L556328,m540
 There is a way., I knew it!, L556332, L556331,m540
 But it's impossible., Why?, L556334, L556333,m540
 Then teach me how.," No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.", L556338, L556337,m540
" Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life", Then come with me., L556341, L556340,m540
 Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?, You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers., L556343, L556342,m540
" Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?"," Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.", L556345, L556344,m540
 You're going to take me back?, Going to try. Didn't say I could., L556348, L556347,m540
" I heard my mother ask you once ""how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?"" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart."," Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!", L556350, L556349,m540
 You can use the wand., Better than when I was a child., L556383, L556382,m540
 What's that? Never saw anything like that., Don't stop. Keep moving., L556386, L556385,m540

 Yeah? What do you want?," Buddy, are we in trouble.", L556886, L556885,m541
 What?," First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it?

" No, they don't.", Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation., L580733, L580732,m556
 You've got something to show me., Yes., L580272, L580271,m556
" We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.", Brought on by what?, L580274, L580273,m556
 This man's still alive.," Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.", L580277, L580276,m556
 How can this be?," The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.", L580279, L580278,m556
" Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?", No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it., L580281, L580280,m556
 And if it's unsuccessful?, Incinerate it. Like the others., L580283, L580282,m556
 This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.," Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.", L580285, L580284,m556
 Of what?," They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.  Maybe a small roadside memorial.", L580287, L580286,m556
 Yes., We have a situation. The members are assembling., L580412, L580411,m556
 Who called this meeting?, Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis., L580417, L580416,m556
 Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body., Into what?, L580428, L580427,m556
 My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken., There are complications., L580445, L580444,m556
 Do they know?, Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him., L580447, L580446,m556
 Who?," Kurtzweil, we think.", L580449, L580448,m556
 Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?, You got some kind of business with him?, L580322, L580321,m556
 I'm looking for him., Looking for him for what?, L580324, L580323,m556
" Feds are looking for him, too.  Real nice business he's got, huh?", What's that?, L580326, L580325,m556
 You looking for him for some other reason?," Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.", L580329, L580328,m556
 You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?, No. Don't bother., L580331, L580330,m556
 I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.," We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.", L580382, L580381,m556
 Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?," Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.", L580384, L580383,m556
 Have you examined them?," No. Just fossils, far as I know.", L580386, L580385,m556
 You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found., Show you right on a map., L580398, L580397,m556
 How's that?, Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding., L580224, L580223,m556
 Do I know you?, No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that., L580226, L580225,m556
 You follow me out here for a reason?," Yeah, I did.", L580228, L580227,m556
 My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil., I know the name. Why?, L580230, L580229,m556
 How'd you find me?, Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight., L580235, L580234,m556
 You a reporter?," I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.", L580237, L580236,m556
 Who sent you?, I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas., L580239, L580238,m556
 And what's that?, S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb., L580243, L580242,m556
 He just let it explode., What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?, L580245, L580244,m556
 The Federal Building was too well guarded., No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing..., L580247, L580246,m556
 Those people were already dead., Before the bomb went off?, L580250, L580249,m556
 Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --, Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict., L580253, L580252,m556
 You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?, And one little boy., L580255, L580254,m556
 I think you're full of shit., Do you?, L580257, L580256,m556
 See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you., Not according to the men in blue., L580333, L580332,m556
 What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states., They want to discredit you -- for what?, L580335, L580334,m556
 For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth., You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why., L580337, L580336,m556
 You know my work?," Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --", L580339, L580338,m556
" I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?", How?, L580342, L580341,m556
 I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper., You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?, L580344, L580343,m556
" According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?", It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago., L580346, L580345,m556
 And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?, Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?, L580348, L580347,m556
 What was it?," When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.", L580351, L580350,m556
 What killed those men?," What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.", L580353, L580352,m556
 I'll know soon enough.," What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted", L580355, L580354,m556
 A plague?," The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.", L580357, L580356,m556
 Negotiating with whom?," I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.", L580359, L580358,m556
 And they tell me I'm paranoid.," Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.", L580361, L580360,m556
 How can I reach you?, You can't., L580363, L580362,m556
 You found something?, Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks., L580559, L580558,m556
 What?, I'm not sure. A virus --, L580561, L580560,m556
 -- You saw this experiment?, What did it look like?, L580563, L580562,m556
 What do you think?, A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus., L580567, L580566,m556
 That would be my guess., Your guess?, L580569, L580568,m556
 You told me you had answers.," Yeah, well I don't have them all.", L580572, L580571,m556
 You've been using me --, I've been using you?!, L580574, L580573,m556
 You didn't know my father --, I told you -- he and I were old friends --, L580576, L580575,m556
 You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you., Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters., L580580, L580579,m556
 Mulder -- it's me --," Where are you, Scully?", L580097, L580096,m556
 I'm on the roof., Did you find something?, L580099, L580098,m556
 No. I haven't.," What's wrong, Scully?", L580101, L580100,m556
" I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.", You're looking for a bomb., L580103, L580102,m556
 I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street., I think they have that covered., L580105, L580104,m556
 Mulder...?, What happened to playing a hunch?, L580108, L580107,m556
" Jesus, Mulder..."," The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...", L580110, L580109,m556
" I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.", How's that?, L580113, L580112,m556
 You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol., What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome., L580115, L580114,m556
 Now what?, It's locked?, L580117, L580116,m556
 Had you., No you didn't., L580120, L580119,m556
" I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic."," Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?", L580123, L580122,m556
" Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?", Something sweet., L580126, L580125,m556
 Scully...," Scully, I found the bomb.", L580129, L580128,m556
" Where are you, Mulder?", I'm in the vending room., L580131, L580130,m556
" Scully, get somebody to open this door."," Nice try, Mulder.", L580134, L580133,m556
 Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.," Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...", L580138, L580137,m556
 ...thirteen fifty six..., Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there., L580140, L580139,m556
 Scully?, Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it., L580148, L580147,m556
 Something's not right..., -- Mulder! Get in the car!, L580164, L580163,m556
" Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.", All I told them was the truth., L580194, L580193,m556
" They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them."," They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.", L580196, L580195,m556
 What? What are you talking about?, I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment..., L580198, L580197,m556
 Why?, I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993., L580200, L580199,m556
 They were the ones that put us together.," Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.", L580202, L580201,m556
" This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me."," They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.", L580204, L580203,m556
 You're... quitting?," There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.", L580206, L580205,m556
 I wake you?, No., L580259, L580258,m556
" Are you drunk, Mulder?", I was until about an hour ago., L580262, L580261,m556
" What are you implying, Scully?", I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting., L580265, L580264,m556
" Go home, Mulder. It's late."," Get dressed, Scully.", L580268, L580267,m556
 Mulder -- what are you doing?, Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way., L580270, L580269,m556
 This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?, According to this tag., L580303, L580302,m556
 It's like jelly., There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous., L580310, L580309,m556
 And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here," You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.", L580312, L580311,m556
 You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here., I'd been told as much., L580315, L580314,m556
 You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?, I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced., L580317, L580316,m556
" Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics."," We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?", L580319, L580318,m556
 Why are you whispering?, I can't really talk right now., L580368, L580367,m556
 What did you find?, Evidence of a massive infection., L580370, L580369,m556
 What kind of infection?, I don't know., L580372, L580371,m556
" Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.", Mulder --, L580374, L580373,m556
 I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by., I've got a hearing tomorrow --, L580376, L580375,m556
" -- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.", Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --, L580378, L580377,m556
 You said you weren't coming?, I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen., L580390, L580389,m556
 What did you find?," Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.", L580392, L580391,m556
 How was it contracted?," That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.", L580394, L580393,m556
 He didn't mention a park.," This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.", L580462, L580461,m556
 You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?," The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.", L580465, L580464,m556
 And you've never seen anything like that?, No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --, L580467, L580466,m556
 This looks like new grass to you?, It looks pretty green for this climate., L580469, L580468,m556
" Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.", All the equipment is brand new., L580471, L580470,m556
 Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?," I don't know, Mulder.", L580491, L580490,m556
 And where are they going with it?," That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.", L580493, L580492,m556
 What are my choices?, About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction., L580495, L580494,m556
 Where would they be going?, We've got two choices. One of them is wrong., L580497, L580496,m556
 You think they went left?, I don't know why I think they went right., L580499, L580498,m556
" Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?", This is great. This is fitting., L580502, L580501,m556
 What?," I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.", L580504, L580503,m556
" We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --", -- of what exactly?!, L580506, L580505,m556
" That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself."," They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.", L580508, L580507,m556

" This is weird, Mulder.", Very weird., L580520, L580519,m556
 Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?, Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there., L580522, L580521,m556
 Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated., For the purpose of what?, L580524, L580523,m556
 You hear that?, I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe., L580527, L580526,m556

 Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.," You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times", L580597, L580596,m556

 Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.

 Darling!?!," I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.", L665968, L665967,m615
" Ready, darling?"," Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.", L665978, L665977,m615

 Are you suggesting I call him master???," No, of course not.  I just meant...", L665985, L665984,m615
 Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.," Darling, you mustn't worry so.", L665999, L665998,m615
 But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.," But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.", L666001, L666000,m615
" Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?"," You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.", L666003, L666002,m615
 I suppose you're right., Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy., L666005, L666004,m615
 Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?," Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.", L666008, L666007,m615
 I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.," Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??", L666011, L666010,m615
 That's a tough choice., Is it worth taking a chance?, L666013, L666012,m615
 I suppose you're right., Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy., L666015, L666014,m615
 Good night., That's my good boy., L666017, L666016,m615

 No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.," May I have it, please?", L665600, L665599,m615

 I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?," I don't know what you mean, sir.", L665605, L665604,m615

 Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?," I think you must be mistaken, sir.", L665609, L665608,m615
 Well... we'll see., Will there be anything else?, L665611, L665610,m615
 I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?," I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.", L665613, L665612,m615

 What?, Break that old man's violin., L665480, L665479,m615
 I didn't do that., The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee., L665482, L665481,m615
" All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?"," Yes, sir.", L665485, L665484,m615
 One week at the most!?," One week -- I'll see to it, sir.", L665487, L665486,m615
" Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.", Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there., L665490, L665489,m615

" No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!", But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?, L665390, L665389,m615
" I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions.", Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses., L665393, L665392,m615
" In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?", Dr. Fronkonsteen!, L665426, L665425,m615
" Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?", A piece of what?, L665429, L665428,m615

" But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?", My father was a sick man., L665437, L665436,m615
" But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?", You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind., L665439, L665438,m615
" Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?"," How old are you, young man?", L665441, L665440,m615
" Nineteen, sir."," Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.", L665443, L665442,m615
 But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!, Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System., L665445, L665444,m615
" But, sir...", I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher., L665447, L665446,m615

 I see., You must be Igor., L665539, L665538,m615
" No, it's pronounced Aye gor.", But they told me it was Ee gor., L665541, L665540,m615
" Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?"," You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?", L665543, L665542,m615

 It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?, What?, L665654, L665653,m615
 You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?," Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.", L665656, L665655,m615
 Did you see anyone else down here?," No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.", L665662, L665661,m615
