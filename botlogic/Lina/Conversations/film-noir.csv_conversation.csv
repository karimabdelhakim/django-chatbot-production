 Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl, Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer., L554909, L554908,m539
 Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey., Get out!, L554912, L554911,m539
" Just a minute, you!", Yeah?, L554915, L554914,m539
" You're a writer, you said.", Why?, L554917, L554916,m539
 Are you or aren't you?, I think that's what it says on my driver's license., L554919, L554918,m539
" And you have written pictures, haven't you?"," Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.", L554921, L554920,m539
 The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ.  I ought to have it taken out., Or teach it a better tune., L554924, L554923,m539
" How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?", Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc., L554926, L554925,m539
 This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years., Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures., L554928, L554927,m539
 It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it., Uh-huh., L554930, L554929,m539
 We've made a lot of pictures together., And you'll play Salome?, L554932, L554931,m539
 Who else ?, Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback., L554934, L554933,m539
 I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen., Fair enough., L554936, L554935,m539
" Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.", They'll love it in Pomona., L554938, L554937,m539
 They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!, Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it., L554940, L554939,m539
 Well?, This is fascinating., L554948, L554947,m539
 Of course it is., Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer., L554950, L554949,m539
 I wrote that with my heart., Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue., L554952, L554951,m539
 What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes., It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil., L554954, L554953,m539
 I will not have it butchered., Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody., L554956, L554955,m539
" Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?", I don't know., L554958, L554957,m539
 What month?, December twenty-first., L554960, L554959,m539
 Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them., Thank you., L554962, L554961,m539
 I want you to do this work., Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment., L554964, L554963,m539
" You know, I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.", I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while., L554967, L554966,m539
 Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -, Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here., L554969, L554968,m539
 It's getting kind of late --," Are you married, Mr.  -- ?", L554971, L554970,m539
 The name is Gillis.  I'm single., Where do you live?, L554973, L554972,m539
 Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.," There's something wrong with your car, you said.", L554975, L554974,m539
 There sure is., You can stay here., L554977, L554976,m539
" I don't know why you should be so upset.  Stop that playing, Max.  It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together."," Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.", L555003, L555002,m539
 You'll like it here.," Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.", L555005, L555004,m539
 You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent., I'll take care of that., L555007, L555006,m539
 It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for., I'm used to paying my own bills., L555009, L555008,m539
" You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.", Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary., L555011, L555010,m539
" Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.", Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying., L555013, L555012,m539
 What's that?, Just a scene I cut out., L555017, L555016,m539
 What scene?, The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -, L555019, L555018,m539
 Cut away from me?," Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.", L555021, L555020,m539
" They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.", Okay., L555023, L555022,m539
 I want to talk to you for a minute.," Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.", L555036, L555035,m539
 They've come for my car., Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out., L555038, L555037,m539
 I need some money right now., Can't you wait till I'm dummy?, L555040, L555039,m539
 Now what is it?  Where's the fire?, I've lost my car., L555044, L555043,m539
 Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death., It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!, L555046, L555045,m539
 That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing., What's wrong with It?, L555050, L555049,m539
" Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there !"," I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --", L555052, L555051,m539
 How about some evening clothes?, I don't need a tuxedo., L555056, L555055,m539
 Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails., Tails.  That's ridiculous., L555058, L555057,m539
" Joe,  you look absolutely divine.  Turn around!", , L555083, L555082,m539
 All padding.  Don't let it fool you., Come here!, L555087, L555086,m539
" You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.", I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls., L555089, L555088,m539
" Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.", Cute.  Let's have some drinks., L555091, L555090,m539
 Shouldn't we wait for the others?," Careful, it's slippery.  I had it waxed.", L555093, L555092,m539
 Not on the same floor with Valentino!, Just follow me., L555097, L555096,m539
 Don't bend back like that., It's those feathers.  They tickle., L555099, L555098,m539
 It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here?, Who?, L555101, L555100,m539
 The other guests?, There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me., L555103, L555102,m539
 Hold me tighter.," Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?", L555106, L555105,m539
 You think this is all very funny., A little., L555108, L555107,m539
 Is it funny that I'm in love with you?, What's that?, L555110, L555109,m539
 What are the notes?," ""Mad about the boy.""", L555118, L555117,m539
" Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.", Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars., L555120, L555119,m539
 Keep it.," I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.", L555122, L555121,m539
 What's the matter with you?, What right do you have to take me for granted?, L555125, L555124,m539
 What right? Do you want me to tell you?, Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?, L555127, L555126,m539
" Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?", Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --, L555129, L555128,m539
 Go away., What kind of a silly thing was that to do?, L555217, L555216,m539
 To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing., It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer., L555219, L555218,m539
 Go away.  Go to that girl of yours.," Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.", L555222, L555221,m539
" Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --", Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being., L555224, L555223,m539
 You're really going to send it to De Mille?, This is the right day., L555240, L555239,m539
 Did she read the script?, DeMille is Leo.  I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks.  Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around.  Let me dry you., L555242, L555241,m539
" I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.", I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star., L555244, L555243,m539
" When did he say it, Norma?", So he said it quite a few years ago.  So what?  I never looked better in my life.  Do you know why?  Because I've never been as happy in my life., L555246, L555245,m539
 Have one of mine., They're awful.  They make me cough., L555250, L555249,m539
" Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.", You're a darling., L555252, L555251,m539
" What on earth, darling? It took you hours.", I ran into some people I knew., L555294, L555293,m539
 Where are my cigarettes?, Where are your...?, L555296, L555295,m539
" I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling?  Why are you so glum?", Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more., L555301, L555300,m539
 How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes., Maybe deMille is shooting., L555316, L555315,m539
" Don't you want to come along, darling?", I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck., L555348, L555347,m539
 How did it go?," It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set.  Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.", L555447, L555446,m539
 He must be quite a guy.," He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.", L555449, L555448,m539
 Don't turn around.  Keep your eyes on the book.," Yes, Norma.", L555456, L555455,m539
 I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive., Good night., L555458, L555457,m539
 I've lost half a pound since Tuesday., Good., L555460, L555459,m539
 I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it., Good., L555462, L555461,m539
 You'd better get to bed yourself., I think I'll read a little., L555464, L555463,m539
" You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?", Why do you say that?, L555466, L555465,m539
 I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?, I went for a walk., L555468, L555467,m539
 No you didn't.  You took the car.," All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?", L555470, L555469,m539
" Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind."," I haven't done anything, Norma.", L555472, L555471,m539
" What are you doing, Joe?  What are you doing?  You're not leaving me?"," Yes, I am, Norma.", L555601, L555600,m539
" No, you're not.  Max! Max!", Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets., L555603, L555602,m539
 The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.," It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.", L555605, L555604,m539
" And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.", These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?, L555607, L555606,m539
" Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more."," You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.", L555609, L555608,m539
" That's between you and yourself, Norma.", You think I made that up about the gun..., L555611, L555610,m539
" See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!", Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene., L555613, L555612,m539
 You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel," Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing yourself to an empty house.  The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.", L555615, L555614,m539
 That's a lie!  They still want me!," No, they don't.", L555617, L555616,m539
 What about the studio? What about De Mille?, He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car., L555619, L555618,m539
 Wanted what?, De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart., L555621, L555620,m539
" That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!"," You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.", L555623, L555622,m539
 You heard him.  I'm a star!," Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.", L555627, L555626,m539
 I'm the greatest star of them all., Goodbye.  Norma., L555629, L555628,m539
 I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought --, Go on in., L554878, L554877,m539
" Look, maybe I'd better take my car --", Wipe your feet!, L554880, L554879,m539
 You are not dressed properly., Dressed for what?, L554882, L554881,m539
 Suppose you listen just for a minute -, Madame is waiting., L554886, L554885,m539
 I made your bed this afternoon.," Thanks.  How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?", L554983, L554982,m539
 This room has not been used for a long time., It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night., L554985, L554984,m539
 There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.," Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.", L554987, L554986,m539
" She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.", I sure turned into an interesting driveway., L554989, L554988,m539
 I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room., Naturally.  I brought them myself., L554997, L554996,m539
 Is that so!, Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?, L554999, L554998,m539
 Some men are here.  They asked for you., I'm not here., L555030, L555029,m539
 That's what I told them., Good., L555032, L555031,m539
 Whose room was this?," It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.", L555065, L555064,m539
" Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.", There are no locks anywhere in this house., L555068, L555067,m539
 How come?, The doctor suggested it., L555070, L555069,m539
 What doctor?, Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts., L555072, L555071,m539
 Uh-huh?," We have to be very careful.  No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.", L555074, L555073,m539
 Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters., I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks., L555076, L555075,m539
" You send them.  Is that it, Max?"," I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.", L555078, L555077,m539
" No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?"," I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.", L555080, L555079,m539
 How is she?, She is upstairs., L555214, L555213,m539
" Mr. Gillis, if you please.", Right with you., L555285, L555284,m539
" You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.", That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid., L555397, L555396,m539
" What's the matter, Max?", I just found out why all those tele- phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond they want.  It is the car they want to rent., L555439, L555438,m539
" What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?", You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching., L555515, L555514,m539
 How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?, I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night..., L555517, L555516,m539
" Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.", It's just that I'm very worried about Madame., L555519, L555518,m539
" Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?", She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed., L555521, L555520,m539
 You made her a star?," I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.", L555523, L555522,m539
 And she's turned you into a servant.," It was I who asked to come back, humiliating as it may seem.  I could have gone on witn my career, only I found everything unendur- able arter she divorced me.  You see, I was her rirst husband.", L555525, L555524,m539
 Joseph C. Gillis?, That's right., L554794, L554793,m539
 We've come for the car., What car?, L554796, L554795,m539
" Relax, fans.  The car isn't here.", Is that So?, L554803, L554802,m539
 I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.," Had to get away for his health, I suppose.", L554805, L554804,m539
 You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.," Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.", L554807, L554806,m539
" All right, Gillis.  You've got five minutes.  What's your story about?"," It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.", L554812, L554811,m539
" So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?", More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good., L554814, L554813,m539
 Got a title?, Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline., L554816, L554815,m539
" Oh, you're one of the message kids.  Just a story won't do. You'd have turned down Gone With the Wind."," No, that was me.  I said, Who wants to see a Civil War picture?", L554833, L554832,m539

" I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?", Comedy. I don't play tragedy., L584909, L584908,m558
 Do I..., Well you read this., L584911, L584910,m558
 Gestern bein heurigen..., What's that?, L584913, L584912,m558
 H-E-Z-T...," Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.", L584916, L584915,m558
 Tell me about him., Tell you what?, L584922, L584921,m558
 When...what did you do?," Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...", L584925, L584924,m558
 ...to steal my girl., Where is she?, L584927, L584926,m558
" Oh, that was many years ago.", Tell me more., L584929, L584928,m558
 ...and buried him., Anna., L584941, L584940,m558
 Seemed like a good idea., It's just what he used to say., L584947, L584946,m558
" Well, I didn't learn that from him.", If we have to see the Porter we'd better go., L584949, L584948,m558
 What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?, I thought you wanted..., L584951, L584950,m558
 A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.," We're both in it, Harry.", L584953, L584952,m558
 Holly., I'm so sorry., L584955, L584954,m558
" That's Harry's place, isn't it?", Yes., L584962, L584961,m558
 Let's go away., What's the matter?, L584964, L584963,m558
 Let's not get into any more trouble., Wait here., L584966, L584965,m558
" Sneak out the other way, and go back to your theatre. I'd better not see you again.", What are you going to do?, L585006, L585005,m558
 I wish I knew., Be sensible - tell Major Calloway., L585008, L585007,m558
 Wer ist da?, Me., L585147, L585146,m558
 I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?, I don't know., L585153, L585152,m558
 I'm going back home., Why?, L585157, L585156,m558
 What happened to your hand?, A parrot...Let it go., L585166, L585165,m558
 Have you seen Calloway?, Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?, L585168, L585167,m558
 ...you know.," He told you, didn't he?", L585172, L585171,m558
 He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that., I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time., L585178, L585177,m558
 He liked to laugh., Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity., L585180, L585179,m558
 ...and my lover. He was Harry.," Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.", L585185, L585184,m558
 ...again., There isn't enough for two laughs., L585198, L585197,m558

 ...Headquarters., Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?, L585427, L585426,m558
 Harry., I'm sorry., L585432, L585431,m558
 What is on your mind? Why did you hide?, Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?, L585435, L585434,m558
" Here, it will be cold on that train.", I shall be all right., L585437, L585436,m558
 What is going to happen? Where is Harry?, He's safe in the Russian zone., L585440, L585439,m558
 How do you know?, I saw him today., L585442, L585441,m558
 Did he say anything about me - tell me?," Oh, the usual things...", L585446, L585445,m558
 Of course I didn't tell Calloway., Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him., L585449, L585448,m558
 That's his headache., His., L585451, L585450,m558
" Oh, well.", Why are you lying?, L585453, L585452,m558
 ...quarrel?," If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.", L585467, L585466,m558
 ...anyway?," From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.", L585510, L585509,m558
" Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?", Of course., L584842, L584841,m558

 Nichts danke. Kein., Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing., L584853, L584852,m558
 ...parents., Yes., L584645, L584644,m558
" Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.", They're Harry's., L584667, L584666,m558
 That's the reason., You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them., L584669, L584668,m558
" They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.", There's nothing in them., L584671, L584670,m558
" Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.", And my passport?, L584780, L584779,m558
" You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?"," We loved each other, do you mean that?", L584784, L584783,m558
 Do you know this man?, I have never seen him., L584786, L584785,m558
 Joseph Harbin..., No., L584788, L584787,m558
 He works in a military hospital., No., L584790, L584789,m558
 In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go., It wasn't important., L584794, L584793,m558
 You can help us., What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down., L584799, L584798,m558
" Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?", Two weeks ago., L585280, L585279,m558
" I want the truth, Miss Schmidt. We know he is alive.", It's true then?, L585282, L585281,m558
 Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin., What did you say? I'm sorry..., L585284, L585283,m558
 I said another man was buried in his place., Where's Harry?, L585286, L585285,m558
 That's what we want to find out., I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something., L585288, L585287,m558
" Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.", I don't know., L585290, L585289,m558
" Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away."," Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.", L585293, L585292,m558
 Must you take those?," They'll be returned, miss.", L584658, L584657,m558
 They are - private - letters.," That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it - like doctors.", L584660, L584659,m558
" There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.", I don't want it., L584688, L584687,m558
" Here we are. You'll be all right here, Miss.", I don't..., L585408, L585407,m558
" Thank you, you have been so kind. Anna moves down to stand CL of Paine."," Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.", L585415, L585414,m558
 Yes., I was a friend of Harry Lime., L584397, L584396,m558
" I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.", Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?, L584399, L584398,m558
 Where?, Just around the corner., L584401, L584400,m558
 How will I know you?, I'll carry a copy of one of your books. Harry gave it to me., L584403, L584402,m558
 What is it?, This is forgery. It is very clever., L584773, L584772,m558
 We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?," No, not yet.", L584775, L584774,m558
" Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?"," Yes, of course.", L584777, L584776,m558
 ...Austrian Police Headquarters., Can I have that woman's passport?, L585141, L585140,m558
 Can you tell me whose..., Fellow called Lime., L584255, L584254,m558
 My name is Calloway., Martins., L584274, L584273,m558
 You a friend of Lime's?, Yes., L584276, L584275,m558
 Been here long?, No., L584278, L584277,m558
" You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.", Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks., L584280, L584279,m558
 Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up., When did you see him last?, L584285, L584284,m558
 See much of him before that?, Once in a while., L584290, L584289,m558
 I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again?, Holly Martins., L584295, L584294,m558
" Did you ever hear of ""The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?""", I can't say that I have., L584298, L584297,m558
" ""Death at the Double X Ranch"" - Ra- a-nch.", No., L584300, L584299,m558
 Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame., What?, L584302, L584301,m558
 Him dying like that., Best thing that ever happened..., L584304, L584303,m558
 ...to him., What are you trying to say?, L584306, L584305,m558
 ...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs., Ever seen one?, L584313, L584312,m558
 ...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose., It wasn't petrol., L584319, L584318,m558
 Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?," Well, you could say that murder was part...", L584323, L584322,m558
" Listen, Callaghan."," Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.", L584331, L584330,m558
 ...expense., Going to find me the real criminal? It sounds like one of your stories., L584334, L584333,m558
 What the devil?," Getting around, Martins.", L584638, L584637,m558
 And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you., I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead., L584662, L584661,m558
" Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?", Calloway., L584665, L584664,m558
 Miss Schmidt., You're not locking her up?, L584681, L584680,m558
 Get the next plane.," As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.", L584684, L584683,m558

 Well?, In Vienna..., L585099, L585098,m558
 Do you see what that means?, Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?, L585102, L585101,m558
 That is the racket Harry Lime organized.," Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.", L585107, L585106,m558
" Next, Paine.", I would like a word with this orderly Harbin., L585123, L585122,m558

 I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.," Yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, I suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...", L585229, L585228,m558
