" Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.", I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls., L64634, L64633,m28
" Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?", Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family., L64636, L64635,m28
" Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset."," Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.", L64638, L64637,m28
" Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?"," Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!", L64658, L64657,m28

" Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me."," I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?", L64798, L64797,m28
 I don't know.," Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.", L64800, L64799,m28

" Where is my rascal, Lazlo?", I will let down the steps for your honor., L64831, L64830,m28
 Good gracious!  What is this?, You are going to drive to the frontier., L64833, L64832,m28
 It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.," I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.", L64835, L64834,m28
 Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand., Your honor must lower his voice., L64837, L64836,m28
 All Europe shall hear of this!, As you please., L64839, L64838,m28
 I have no luggage., The gentleman has nothing contraband., L64843, L64842,m28
 You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?," Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.", L64773, L64772,m28
 Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?," Yes, sir.", L64775, L64774,m28
 You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach., Herr Seebach was a very kind employer., L64777, L64776,m28
 For whom else have you worked?," No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.", L64779, L64778,m28

" The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards?"," I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.", L64791, L64790,m28

" Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?"," Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.", L64845, L64844,m28

 It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman., To risk one's life against such people is an imposition., L64909, L64908,m28

" I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you"," Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?", L64894, L64893,m28
 Perfectly so," Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.", L64896, L64895,m28
 Then you yield to me., On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you., L64898, L64897,m28

 Not one., Have you not a man whom you value?, L64948, L64947,m28
" That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.", What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?, L64950, L64949,m28
 Many worthy of attention, Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty., L64952, L64951,m28
" Your word ""empty"" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it."," It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.", L64954, L64953,m28
" But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune."," That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.", L64956, L64955,m28
" It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.", I agree, L64958, L64957,m28
" A man may need to do that, and find it amusing"," I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.", L64960, L64959,m28
 How so?," By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.", L64962, L64961,m28

 And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?, Then I will respectfully take leave of her., L64973, L64972,m28
 You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?, Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived., L64975, L64974,m28
" Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?"," I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.", L64977, L64976,m28
 Will we always leave it at this?," Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.", L64979, L64978,m28
" I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away."," Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.", L64981, L64980,m28
" Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.", My husband has convinced me of the contrary., L64983, L64982,m28
" Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it."," O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!", L64986, L64985,m28
" Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.", Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy., L64990, L64989,m28
" As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much."," We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  ""Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?""", L64992, L64991,m28
" My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:"," Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly", L65164, L65163,m28
" Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.", Old fool!, L65194, L65193,m28

" Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?", I don't care a fig for Captain Best, L64463, L64462,m28
" But you refused me, Dorothy."," Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.", L64465, L64464,m28
" If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is."," But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.", L64467, L64466,m28
" Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side."," I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.", L64469, L64468,m28
" What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?"," Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.", L64471, L64470,m28
" Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?"," Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.", L64494, L64493,m28
" I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?", As much as possible., L65071, L65070,m28
 As much as possible?," Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.", L65073, L65072,m28

 Does this assignment interest you?," Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.", L64771, L64770,m28
 Was he cheated?, In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly., L64805, L64804,m28

" How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum."," You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.", L64629, L64628,m28
" I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance."," Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.", L65170, L65169,m28
" Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.

Are you serious?, L65174, L65173,m28
 May I be quite frank with you?," Yes, of course.", L65176, L65175,m28
" Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.", I see., L65178, L65177,m28

 I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime," Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you", L64930, L64929,m28
" Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry.", Would you have me spend my life all alone?, L64933, L64932,m28

" Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account."," Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?", L64994, L64993,m28
 I beg your pardon?," Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.", L64996, L64995,m28
" Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith.  Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?"," Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?", L64999, L64998,m28
" Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.

" I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?"," Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.

 An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you., So let the council swear publicly., L110413, L110412,m40
" I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.", He has already agreed to come., L110416, L110415,m40
" Young Robert, we are honored --", My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes., L109892, L109891,m40
 A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council., He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland., L109897, L109896,m40
 Does anyone know his politics?," No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.", L110197, L110196,m40
 May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?, He was a modest man., L110402, L110401,m40
" If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?", Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!, L110407, L110406,m40
 The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.," That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.", L110409, L110408,m40
 He won't come., He will. I know he will., L110428, L110427,m40
 Longshanks promised!, You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king., L110438, L110437,m40
 Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!," I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.", L110023, L110022,m40
 What news of the north?," Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.", L110237, L110236,m40
" While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!", I have ordered conscriptions..., L110239, L110238,m40
 Wallace has sacked York!, Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie., L110241, L110240,m40
 The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!," So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.", L110291, L110290,m40
 Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France., The Scots will fight for us?, L110345, L110344,m40
 What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve., But if we have not caught Wallace --, L110347, L110346,m40
 His legend grows! It will be worse than before!, You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this., L110360, L110359,m40
 What is it?!, You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended., L109874, L109873,m40
 So I did! And what was so important about it?, Scotland. He intends --, L109876, L109875,m40
" Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!", ...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --, L109879, L109878,m40
" No, M'lord.", Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!, L109884, L109883,m40
" Now, my flower, do you understand?"," Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.", L109886, L109885,m40
" Good day to you, M'Lords.", You mock us with a smile?, L110362, L110361,m40
 I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion., Wallace's followers., L110364, L110363,m40
 The little cow is insane --," Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush.", L110370, L110369,m40
 Is it true? Wallace is captured?," Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.", L110434, L110433,m40
 When will his trial be?," Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.", L110436, L110435,m40
 I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace., You fancy him., L110467, L110466,m40
 Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.," Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.", L110471, L110470,m40
 I'll wait... back there.," Hamish, I... thank...", L110046, L110045,m40
 We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long., Fourteen? --, L110052, L110051,m40
" The Bruce is not coming, William.", Mornay has come. So will the Bruce., L110315, L110314,m40
 Stephen ready?, Aye., L110317, L110316,m40
 Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.," We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.", L110376, L110375,m40
" Rest, William.", I rest., L110397, L110396,m40
 You know it's a trap., Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way., L110418, L110417,m40
 I don't want to be a martyr.," Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.", L110420, L110419,m40
" That's just a dream, William!", We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!, L110422, L110421,m40
" Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?"," My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.", L110424, L110423,m40
 Keep these. We're going too., No. One of us is enough., L110426, L110425,m40
 They're coming!, How many?, L109823, L109822,m40
" Three, maybe more!", Armed?, L109825, L109824,m40
" They're English soldiers, ain't they?"," With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!", L109827, L109826,m40
 Wanna stay with me tonight?, I wanna have supper waitin'., L109831, L109830,m40
 We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.," Aye, we'll get 'em.", L109833, L109832,m40
 Test of manhood., You win., L109905, L109904,m40
" Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.", The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here., L109907, L109906,m40
 I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can., That depends on the man., L109911, L109910,m40
 Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?, I could crush you like a roach., L109913, L109912,m40
 You'll move, I will not., L109916, L109915,m40
 Good to see you again., I should'a remembered the eggs., L109927, L109926,m40
" All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?", Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?, L110062, L110061,m40
" Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.", A common thief., L110068, L110067,m40
 We must run in different directions!, We don't split up!, L110088, L110087,m40
 I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine., He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won., L110350, L110349,m40
 So more men were slaughtered uselessly!, He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight., L110352, L110351,m40
" We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.", In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break., L110354, L110353,m40
 Where is my son?," Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.", L109866, L109865,m40
 I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!," Shall I leave, M'lord?", L109868, L109867,m40
" My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.", No. He did not., L110278, L110277,m40
 Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced., He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him., L110280, L110279,m40
 You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?," ...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.", L110282, L110281,m40
" The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery."," Humbly, M'lord.", L110284, L110283,m40
 No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war., This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool., L110287, L110286,m40
" Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.", My greatness is better demonstrated with this., L110289, L110288,m40
 I have faced him. Have you?, Let her speak., L110367, L110366,m40
 Treason. Against whom?," Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?", L110441, L110440,m40
" Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --"," It matters not, he is thy king!", L110443, L110442,m40
" -- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!"," Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!", L110445, L110444,m40
 I do not confess.," Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.", L110447, L110446,m40
" Your father doesn't like me, does he?", It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long., L109940, L109939,m40
 Thank you for accepting., Thank you for inviting., L109942, L109941,m40
" I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.", You are. And I'll come again., L109944, L109943,m40
 You've been here before?, Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure., L109956, L109955,m40
 Did it work?, No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you., L109958, L109957,m40
 I want... to marry you!, I... accept your proposal!, L109960, L109959,m40
 I'm not just saying it!, Nor I!, L109962, L109961,m40
 But I won't give you up to any nobleman., You scare me., L109964, L109963,m40
" I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.", This night is too beautiful to have again., L109966, L109965,m40
 I've missed you., Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever., L109974, L109973,m40
 Tonight then., My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!, L109976, L109975,m40
 Then when?, ...Tonight!, L109978, L109977,m40
 I'm dreaming.," Yes, you are. And you must wake.", L110079, L110078,m40
 I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you., And I with you. But you must wake., L110081, L110080,m40
 I need you so much! I love you!," Wake up, William. Wake up!", L110083, L110082,m40
 When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north., How do you know this?, L110115, L110114,m40
 Last night I slept with a member of the War Council., He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed., L110117, L110116,m40
 This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?," A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.", L110120, L110119,m40
" Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?", ...I wouldn't know., L110122, L110121,m40
 I am the Princess of Wales.," Wife of Edward, the king's son?", L110252, L110251,m40
" I come as the king's servant, and with his authority."," It's battle I want, not talk.", L110254, L110253,m40
 I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight., I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are., L110257, L110256,m40
" Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?"," York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.", L110259, L110258,m40
" Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.", A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas., L110270, L110269,m40
 Peace is made is such ways., SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!, L110272, L110271,m40
 I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman., She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant., L110274, L110273,m40
 A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it., It does me good to see you., L110380, L110379,m40
 Why did you?, Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met., L110386, L110385,m40
 You have... you have a husband.," I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.", L110390, L110389,m40
" You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?", I cannot love you for the sake of revenge., L110392, L110391,m40
 M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.," Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.", L110456, L110455,m40
" Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?"," Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.", L110458, L110457,m40
 You will die! It will be awful!, Every man dies. Not every man really lives., L110462, L110461,m40
 Drink this! It will dull your pain.," It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.", L110464, L110463,m40
" Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk."," And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?", L110216, L110215,m40
" No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.", We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why., L110218, L110217,m40
 I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.," Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.", L110220, L110219,m40
 War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you., I am trying., L110306, L110305,m40
 Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it., I must... consult with my father., L110308, L110307,m40
 We can't stop!, They've tricked us., L110095, L110094,m40
" What's the crazy man saying, Lord?", The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them., L110097, L110096,m40
 Who would do such a thing?, Exactly., L110099, L110098,m40
 I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!, No English lord would trust an Irishman!, L110107, L110106,m40
 Fine speech. Now what do we do?, Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field., L110156, L110155,m40
" Come, it'll help you sleep.", Aye. But it won't let me dream., L110400, L110399,m40
 Monsieur Rick?, Yes?, L119106, L119105,m42
 How did you get in here? You're under age., I came with Captain Renault., L119109, L119108,m42
 I should have known.," My husband is with me, too.", L119111, L119110,m42
" No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?", No., L119114, L119113,m42
" Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?"," Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.", L119116, L119115,m42
" No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --"," -- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?", L119118, L119117,m42
 He did. Captain Renault did., I thought so. Where's your husband?, L119120, L119119,m42
 How long have you been married?," Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.", L119123, L119122,m42
 So you decided to go to America.," Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.", L119125, L119124,m42
" Yes, I'll bet."," He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.", L119127, L119126,m42
 Does he know that?," Oh, yes.", L119129, L119128,m42
 And he is still willing to give you a visa?," Yes, Monsieur.", L119131, L119130,m42
 And you want to know --, -- Will he keep his word?, L119133, L119132,m42
 Nobody ever loved me that much.," And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?", L119137, L119136,m42
 You want my advice?," Oh, yes, please.", L119139, L119138,m42
 Go back to Bulgaria.," Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.", L119141, L119140,m42
" Monsieur Rick, I --", -- He's just a lucky guy., L119167, L119166,m42
" Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.", Well?, L118663, L118662,m42
 You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.," Thank you, but I hardly think --", L118665, L118664,m42
 Good., What is your name?, L118669, L118668,m42
 Such a bargain. But that is your decision?, I'm sorry. It is., L118674, L118673,m42
" Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?"," Yes, Monsieur.", L118717, L118716,m42
" I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo."," In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.", L118720, L118719,m42
 We read five times that you were killed in five different places.," As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.", L118722, L118721,m42
 I see.," But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come...", L118725, L118724,m42
" Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?"," No thanks, Carl.", L119169, L119168,m42
" Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.", How long can I afford to stay closed?, L119260, L119259,m42
" Oh, two weeks, maybe three."," Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.", L119262, L119261,m42
" Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?", I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --, L119265, L119264,m42
 -- Don't tell me where you're going., I won't., L119267, L119266,m42
 Goodnight.," Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.", L119269, L119268,m42
 The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment., Come up here a minute., L119322, L119321,m42
" Yes, I come.", I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police., L119324, L119323,m42
 But Sacha always puts out that light --, -- Tonight he forgot., L119326, L119325,m42
 I want you to take Miss Lund home.," Yes, sir.", L119329, L119328,m42
" Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money."," Well, I'll get it from the safe.", L118520, L118519,m42
" I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --"," -- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.", L118522, L118521,m42
 Here you are.," It shall not happen again, Monsieur.", L118536, L118535,m42
" Here's to you, sir."," Er, good luck, yes.", L119045, L119044,m42
 I'd better be going.," Er, my check, please.", L119047, L119046,m42

 You haven't heard my offer., It's not for sale at any price., L118466, L118465,m42
 What do you want for Sam?, I don't buy or sell human beings., L118468, L118467,m42
 That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market., Suppose you run your business and let me run mine., L118470, L118469,m42
 Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change., Suppose we do., L118472, L118471,m42
 I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me., No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me., L118968, L118967,m42
" I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short."," Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.", L118970, L118969,m42
 The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much., You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do., L118972, L118971,m42
 Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are., Practically no one., L118974, L118973,m42
" If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.", So could I. And I'm a poor businessman., L118976, L118975,m42
" I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.", And the carrying charges?, L118978, L118977,m42
 Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters., I'll tell him when he comes in., L118980, L118979,m42
" Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are."," Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.", L118982, L118981,m42
 That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.," Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.", L118984, L118983,m42
" Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?"," It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.", L119379, L119378,m42
" Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man."," Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.", L119381, L119380,m42
 Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.," And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.", L119383, L119382,m42
 Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.," Well, so long.", L119385, L119384,m42
" Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.", I shall remember to pay it... to myself., L119387, L119386,m42
" You see, my dear, the word has gone around."," As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.", L119013, L119012,m42
 I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while --," -- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles.", L119018, L119017,m42
" We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much."," Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?", L119031, L119030,m42
" I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?"," Yes, something.", L119034, L119033,m42
 Do you know where they are?," Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.", L119037, L119036,m42
 Rick?," He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.", L119039, L119038,m42
" It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.", Good day., L119043, L119042,m42
 And Mademoiselle?, You needn't be concerned about me., L118929, L118928,m42
" Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.", This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca., L119220, L119219,m42
" That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.", Occupied France?, L119222, L119221,m42
 Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me., What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past., L119224, L119223,m42
 There are only two other alternatives for him., What are they?, L119226, L119225,m42
 It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here., And the other alternative?, L119228, L119227,m42
" -- It was ""La Belle Aurore."""," How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.", L118781, L118780,m42
 Not an easy day to forget., No., L118783, L118782,m42
" I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue."," Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.", L118785, L118784,m42
 Say goodnight to Sam for me., I will., L118797, L118796,m42
" There's still nobody in the world who can play ""As Time Goes By"" like Sam.", He hasn't played it in a long time., L118799, L118798,m42
 Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?," We said ""no questions.""", L118845, L118844,m42
 A franc for your thoughts., In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth., L118848, L118847,m42
 I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me., And I was wondering., L118850, L118849,m42
 Yes?, Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along., L118852, L118851,m42

 That's easy. There was. He's dead.," I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said ""no questions.""", L118856, L118855,m42
" Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here."," I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.", L118860, L118859,m42
 My German's a little rusty., It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow., L118865, L118864,m42
" With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love."," Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?", L118867, L118866,m42
 Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?, Looking for a job., L118869, L118868,m42
" Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?"," Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.", L118871, L118870,m42
 Strange. I know so very little about you.," I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.", L118876, L118875,m42
" But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris."," No, no, no, no. We must leave.", L118878, L118877,m42
" Yes, of course, we --", -- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty., L118880, L118879,m42
" No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?"," All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?", L118882, L118881,m42
 That's too far ahead to plan.," Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?", L118884, L118883,m42
" Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?"," I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen.

 Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.," No. No, Rick. Not tonight.", L118894, L118893,m42
 Please., Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places., L118897, L118896,m42
" I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know."," It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. ""Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop.""", L118899, L118898,m42
" Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel."," Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?", L118901, L118900,m42
 I didn't count the days.," Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.", L118903, L118902,m42
" Can I tell you a story, Rick?", Has it got a wow finish?, L118905, L118904,m42
 I don't know the finish yet.," Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.", L118907, L118906,m42
" It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love."," Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, ""Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid,"" it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?", L118909, L118908,m42
 I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night., It doesn't matter., L118993, L118992,m42
 Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?, Yes., L119000, L118999,m42

" Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know."," Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.", L119004, L119003,m42
" Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?", You can believe that if you want to., L119006, L119005,m42
" All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there."," No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.", L119009, L119008,m42

 Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?," It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.", L119281, L119280,m42

I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.", L119301, L119300,m42
" Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me.

" I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us."," All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.", L119312, L119311,m42

" I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.", No., L119457, L119456,m42

" Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?", Go ahead., L119185, L119184,m42
" Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.", My office., L119187, L119186,m42
" You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work.", I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper., L119190, L119189,m42
 My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain., What of it?, L119192, L119191,m42
 Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?," Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.", L119194, L119193,m42
 Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?," I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.", L119196, L119195,m42
 I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.," My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.", L119198, L119197,m42
 There must be some reason why you won't let me have them., There is. I suggest that you ask your wife., L119200, L119199,m42
 I beg your pardon?," I said, ask your wife.", L119202, L119201,m42
" Well, this might come in handy.", Thank you., L119332, L119331,m42
" Had a close one, eh?"," Yes, rather.", L119334, L119333,m42
 Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?," We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.", L119336, L119335,m42
" You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil."," Yes, I get the point.", L119339, L119338,m42
 I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed., You seem to know all about my destiny., L119341, L119340,m42
" I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.", You love her that much?, L119343, L119342,m42
" Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you."," Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.", L119410, L119409,m42
" I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.", Keep it. You'll need it in America., L119412, L119411,m42
 But we made a deal.," Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?", L119414, L119413,m42
 No. It's all arranged.," Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.", L119416, L119415,m42
 Everything in order?, All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave., L119465, L119464,m42
" Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything."," I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.", L119467, L119466,m42
 Yes.," But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?", L119469, L119468,m42
 I understand., Here it is., L119473, L119472,m42
" Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?", Yes., L118676, L118675,m42
" I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.", Yes. What is it you want?, L118678, L118677,m42
 Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.," Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?", L118680, L118679,m42
" No, Captain, please."," No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.", L118687, L118686,m42
 Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word., Very well., L118706, L118705,m42
 My bill.," No. Two champagne cocktails, please.", L118733, L118732,m42
" Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!", This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you., L118772, L118771,m42
" Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle."," Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.", L118787, L118786,m42
 Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office., We'll be there., L118806, L118805,m42
 I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?, I slept very well., L118918, L118917,m42
 That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca., May we proceed with the business?, L118920, L118919,m42
 With pleasure. Won't you sit down?, Thank you., L118922, L118921,m42
" I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur."," Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.", L118927, L118926,m42
 And the honor of having served the Third Reich., I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime., L118937, L118936,m42
" Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --", -- Thank you., L118944, L118943,m42
" By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.", Yes., L118946, L118945,m42
 I believe you have a message for him?," Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?", L118948, L118947,m42
 I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape., Are you quite finished with us?, L118952, L118951,m42
" I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.", You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!, L118699, L118698,m42
" I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.", I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil., L118701, L118700,m42
 This is hardly the time or the place.," Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.", L118703, L118702,m42
" Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca."," Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.", L118924, L118923,m42
 Is that all you wish to tell us?," Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.", L118931, L118930,m42
 And that is?," You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.", L118933, L118932,m42
 Even in Berlin.," Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.", L118935, L118934,m42
 You will give us the names?," If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more ""persuasive methods"" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now.", L118939, L118938,m42
" And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast."," Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.", L118941, L118940,m42
 For the time being., Good day., L118954, L118953,m42
 Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.," Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.", L118385, L118384,m42
" You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major."," Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.", L118390, L118389,m42
" What else, my dear Major?"," By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?", L118392, L118391,m42
" Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's."," I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.", L118397, L118396,m42
" Good evening, gentlemen."," Good evening, Captain.", L118585, L118584,m42
" Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.", Champagne and a tin of caviar., L118588, L118587,m42
" May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.", Thank you., L118590, L118589,m42
" Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers."," I expected no less, Captain.", L118594, L118593,m42
" Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich."," How do you do, Mr. Rick?", L118613, L118612,m42
" You repeat ""Third Reich"" as though you expected there to be others."," Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.", L118619, L118618,m42
" Ho, diplomatist!", How about New York?, L118633, L118632,m42
" Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.", You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you., L118638, L118637,m42
" Of course, one must admit he has great courage.", I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again., L118649, L118648,m42
" You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.", Perhaps., L118653, L118652,m42
 Mademoiselle., Mademoiselle., L118708, L118707,m42
 I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.," If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.", L118911, L118910,m42
 You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.," But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they ""blundered"" into Berlin in 1918.", L118913, L118912,m42
" As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.", It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here., L118915, L118914,m42
" You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe."," My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.", L119078, L119077,m42
" Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?"," I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.", L119080, L119079,m42
" We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader."," A leader, like Laszlo?", L119084, L119083,m42
" Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.", I see what you mean., L119086, L119085,m42
" You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.", But everybody's having such a good time., L119209, L119208,m42
" Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.", But I have no excuse to close it., L119211, L119210,m42
 What is the meaning of that phone call?, Victor Laszlo is on that plane., L119486, L119485,m42
 Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?, Ask Monsieur Rick., L119488, L119487,m42
" Hello, Louis."," How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.", L118505, L118504,m42
" You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?"," When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.", L118507, L118506,m42
 The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?, Why? What's in Lisbon?, L118510, L118509,m42
 It was a combination of all three., And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?, L118514, L118513,m42
 My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters., Waters? What waters? We're in the desert., L118516, L118515,m42
 I was misinformed., Huh!, L118518, L118517,m42
" Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe."," What, again?", L118525, L118524,m42
" If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.", I stick my neck out for nobody., L118528, L118527,m42
" You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.", Our entertainment is enough., L118531, L118530,m42
 I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency., Perhaps not., L118534, L118533,m42
" How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.", Yeah? Have a brandy?, L118540, L118539,m42
" Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.", I thought it was because we let you win at roulette., L118542, L118541,m42
 That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa., Yeah? What's his name?, L118544, L118543,m42
 Victor Laszlo., Victor Laszlo?, L118546, L118545,m42
" Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed."," Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.", L118548, L118547,m42
" It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.", It'll be interesting to see how he manages., L118550, L118549,m42
 Manages what?, His escape., L118552, L118551,m42
" Oh, but I just told you. --", -- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe., L118554, L118553,m42
 This is the end of the chase., Twenty thousand francs says it isn't., L118556, L118555,m42
 Is that a serious offer?, I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back., L118558, L118557,m42
 Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official., Okay., L118560, L118559,m42
" Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.", Why two?, L118562, L118561,m42
 He is traveling with a lady., He'll take one., L118564, L118563,m42
" I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.", Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are., L118566, L118565,m42
 It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.," Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?", L118568, L118567,m42
" Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.", And got well paid for it on both occasions., L118571, L118570,m42
 The winning side would have paid you much better.," Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.", L118573, L118572,m42
 I have my orders.," Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.", L118575, L118574,m42
" Yeah, you were saying?", Excuse me., L118579, L118578,m42
" Oh, how do you do?", And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich., L118615, L118614,m42
 That makes Rick a citizen of the world., I was born in New York City if that'll help you any., L118625, L118624,m42
" Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --"," -- Hello, Ilsa.", L118759, L118758,m42
" Oh, no, Rick never --", -- Thanks. I will., L118770, L118769,m42
" Oh, it's my party."," Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.", L118793, L118792,m42
" Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.", That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open., L119055, L119054,m42
" Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick, have you got these letters of transit?"," Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?", L119057, L119056,m42
 Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.," Well, it looks like you're a little late.", L119059, L119058,m42
 So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.," Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.", L119062, L119061,m42
" As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.", Yeah? Why?, L119180, L119179,m42
 Why do you interfere with my little romances?, Put it down as a gesture to love., L119182, L119181,m42
 How can you close me up? On what grounds?," I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!", L119215, L119214,m42
" But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now."," Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --", L119353, L119352,m42
 -- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?," Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.", L119355, L119354,m42
" Well, they're all excellent reasons."," Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.", L119357, L119356,m42
" You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.", Huh?, L119359, L119358,m42
 And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate., What friend?, L119361, L119360,m42
 Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America., You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?, L119363, L119362,m42
" Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?", It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful., L119367, L119366,m42
" I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance."," There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.", L119370, L119369,m42
 I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?, I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen., L119373, L119372,m42
" Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I."," Oh, thanks.", L119375, L119374,m42
 You're late.," I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.", L119390, L119389,m42
 I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.," Oh, he won't be followed here.", L119392, L119391,m42
" You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky."," Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.", L119394, L119393,m42
 I have the letters right here.," Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?", L119397, L119396,m42
 Sam's piano., Serves me right for not being musical., L119399, L119398,m42
" -- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.", Have you taken leave of your senses?, L119423, L119422,m42
 I have. Sit down over there., Put that gun down., L119425, L119424,m42
" I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?", I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later., L119430, L119429,m42
 Call off your watch-dogs you said.," Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.", L119432, L119431,m42
" If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official."," You think of everything, don't you?", L119444, L119443,m42
 Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist., Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about., L119480, L119479,m42
" What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying."," Anyway, thanks for helping me out.", L119482, L119481,m42
" I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course."," As soon as the plane goes, Louis.", L119484, L119483,m42
" Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot."," Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.", L119501, L119500,m42
 It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while. There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage., My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs., L119504, L119503,m42
 And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses., Our expenses?, L119506, L119505,m42

 I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation., There seems to be no secret about that., L118627, L118626,m42
 Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?, It's not particularly my beloved Paris., L118629, L118628,m42
" Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.", Aha. Who do you think will win the war?, L118635, L118634,m42
 Are my eyes really brown?," You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.", L118643, L118642,m42
 My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.," In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?", L118645, L118644,m42
" Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too."," Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.", L118647, L118646,m42
" You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon."," Good evening, Mr. Blaine.", L118651, L118650,m42

" Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --", -- You thought what?, L118431, L118430,m42
" May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?", They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'., L118434, L118433,m42
 Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?, No., L118438, L118437,m42

" But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas."," For a price, Ugarte, for a price.", L118442, L118441,m42
 But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?, I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one., L118444, L118443,m42
" Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.", Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?, L118446, L118445,m42
" One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca!

 And here is one of Frederick's mother., How lovely., L180370, L180369,m53
 They have noble faces., I've always thought that myself., L180374, L180373,m53
 Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.," She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.", L180380, L180379,m53
" Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment."," If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.", L180382, L180381,m53
 You won't be long?, I'll join you shortly., L179847, L179846,m53

" Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged."," I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.", L180156, L180155,m53
 What do you mean?," Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.", L180158, L180157,m53
 But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?," He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?", L180160, L180159,m53
" Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?"," I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will", L180162, L180161,m53
" Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?", And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?, L180164, L180163,m53
 I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.," Well, these things take time.", L180167, L180166,m53

" Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?", That I am very little different from him., L180503, L180502,m53
" Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.", But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?, L180505, L180504,m53
" Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?", ...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?, L180507, L180506,m53

 What happened?, He fell.  He falls., L179978, L179977,m53
 He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going., Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest., L179981, L179980,m53
 This man belongs in hospital., Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen., L179984, L179983,m53

" DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!"," You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...", L180132, L180131,m53
" Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!", I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that., L180134, L180133,m53
" He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!", All you do is profit from another man's misery!, L180136, L180135,m53
" You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.", You don't own this man!, L180138, L180137,m53

" Good morning, Treves."," Good morning, sir.", L179997, L179996,m53
 You've acquired a taste for this?," It's quite nutritious, sir.", L179999, L179998,m53
 Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you., Indeed!, L180004, L180003,m53
" A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?"," No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.", L180006, L180005,m53
" Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?"," Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.", L180008, L180007,m53
 Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?, Yes sir., L180010, L180009,m53
" What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point."," Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.", L180012, L180011,m53
" Oh, is he a friend of yours?"," No, more of an acquaintance.", L180014, L180013,m53
" I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him."," Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?", L180016, L180015,m53
 Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?," Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.", L180117, L180116,m53
 Good! How is the patient?," He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.", L180119, L180118,m53
 A few words? I thought he was imbecile?," Well sir, perhaps I should explain...", L180121, L180120,m53
" I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.", I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met., L180123, L180122,m53
" No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say ""Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means,"" I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee."," Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.", L180125, L180124,m53
" Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.", Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?, L180147, L180146,m53
 Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?," Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.", L180149, L180148,m53
 Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.," ...Yes, Sir.", L180151, L180150,m53
" It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear."," Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?", L180175, L180174,m53
" ...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.", He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?, L180177, L180176,m53
" Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly."," Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.", L180179, L180178,m53
 Oh yes?," And what was that, John?", L180193, L180192,m53
" It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words."," Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.", L180209, L180208,m53
" How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.", I don't understand., L180217, L180216,m53
 Treves. Well done.," Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.", L180227, L180226,m53
 Can you imagine what his life has been like?," Yes, I think I can.", L180234, L180233,m53
" You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick.", I could easily arrange..., L180237, L180236,m53
" No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?"," Well, yes.", L180239, L180238,m53
" Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.", Do you think they'll go along with us?, L180241, L180240,m53
 Don't we?," No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.", L180255, L180254,m53
 Has the response picked up?," Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.", L180315, L180314,m53
 But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen., Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post., L180317, L180316,m53
 Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...," Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.", L180516, L180515,m53
 How are you feeling today?, I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?, L180185, L180184,m53
" I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?", I feel much better. Thank you., L180187, L180186,m53
 Are you comfortable here?, Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful., L180189, L180188,m53
 ...I... everyone has been very kind to me., Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?, L180203, L180202,m53

" Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.", I don't know what I've got., L179933, L179932,m53
 You never mentioned his mental state.," He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.", L179952, L179951,m53
" Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?", Your majesty shall mock at me, L180704, L180703,m53

 What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?," Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?", L327697, L327696,m104
" Lord, wake me, please.  I must be dreaming."," No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious.  And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago.  How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?", L327710, L327709,m104
" Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss."," Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.", L327756, L327755,m104

" And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!"," I'll go you one better!

 He had his palm print on the weapon.," It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn't find a goddamn thing.  It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue.  There's no chain of evidence, Bill.  And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository?  One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described by Deputy Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - ""a patsy"".  Take it at face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here.  He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, ""O.H. Lee"" to rent the room, right?  What's in a name, right?  In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake.  A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right?  Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?", L327831, L327830,m104

Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.

" I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings."," Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?", L328476, L328475,m104

 Four to six., That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say., L328380, L328379,m104

I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.", L328384, L328383,m104
" If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?"," Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.", L327782, L327781,m104

 Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems?," None!

 None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.," Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that.", L327805, L327804,m104
" The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.", Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet., L327807, L327806,m104

" All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him."," I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying ""We both know who's responsible.""  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?", L327821, L327820,m104
" ...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name ""Oswald"" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy Banister.  Banister has someone using the name ""Oswald"" to buy the trucks.  Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity."," Goddamn!  They put Oswald together from Day One!  Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board.  Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems.  You got the word ""microdots"" in his notebook, you got the Minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions, the sealed DIZ201 personnel file. For all we know, there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities, countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination.

 Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?," Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.", L328031, L328030,m104

" Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here."," That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.", L371019, L371018,m131
 Little light reading matter. Just right for his age.," Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.", L371054, L371053,m131
 This kid's ready but we won't know all the damage till we get in and see what's happened. What have you got?, Nothing can't wait. Shall we check it out with the Major?, L371062, L371061,m131
 Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly., He can't take much more time on the table., L371093, L371092,m131
" Christ Almighty, I think he means it!", We been had., L371110, L371109,m131
 We've stuck it out for a whole week now... Pretty girl.," We sure don't aim to cause any trouble... Yeah, she seems to grow on you.", L371137, L371136,m131
" No, Hawkeye just said it all.", Except we forgot one other small thing., L371146, L371145,m131
 What's that?, The chest-cutter., L371148, L371147,m131
" Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.", This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded., L371150, L371149,m131
" Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?", Sixteen times., L371190, L371189,m131
 Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.," You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.", L371198, L371197,m131
" Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?"," Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.", L371203, L371202,m131
 This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix., Call Dago Red., L371206, L371205,m131
 And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?, Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same., L371214, L371213,m131
 Y'all just act natural.," Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon.  Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up.", L371250, L371249,m131
 That there Frank Burns is a menace. Whenever a patient croaks on him it's either God's will or somebody else's fault.," This time he did it to a kid who's simple enough to believe him. Why don't you dump the mother, Henry? He creates more work than he gets done.", L371364, L371363,m131
" Hail to the chief! We-all got a responsibility, men. He's crowned like a king ought to be, but he can't just walk to the Mess Hall by himself. He has to be carried by native bearers."," Good thinking, Duke. How about it, Ho-Jon? Can you round up a few of the boys?", L371403, L371402,m131
 Never mind. Forget it., A native is someone who is born in a particular place., L371408, L371407,m131
 When will he be able to write?," What's he got to write, for God's sake?", L371693, L371692,m131
 I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan., You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde., L371702, L371701,m131
 How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?," I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.", L371704, L371703,m131
 Where the hell we going to get us a football team?, All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys..., L371761, L371760,m131
 Never heard of him.," Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.", L371765, L371764,m131
 How come nobody knows about him? And you do?," I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.", L371770, L371769,m131
" Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but..."," Don't tell me about your problems, boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.", L371776, L371775,m131
 Look at the size of those two beasts., I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer., L371806, L371805,m131
 Don't try to get it far down. Kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.," Yeah, if I can.", L371817, L371816,m131
" Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.", Same here. You can retire my number., L371853, L371852,m131
 Henry's got our orders! We're going home!, When?, L371870, L371869,m131
 Any time. Whenever we want., Be right with you., L371872, L371871,m131
 There's no transportation anyway this time of night., We could steal one of the choppers., L371878, L371877,m131
 I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets.," We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.", L371897, L371896,m131
 But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there., Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?, L371899, L371898,m131
" Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.", Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army., L371918, L371917,m131
" Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time."," Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.", L371928, L371927,m131
 There's no point appealing to Colonel Blake. They've got him bewitched., No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion., L371390, L371389,m131
 I have a tent to myself., People will talk., L371392, L371391,m131
 I think it's a marvelous letter., We're a good team., L371395, L371394,m131
 We think the same way., It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?, L371397, L371396,m131
 Ravenous. What about you?," Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...", L371399, L371398,m131
" Godless buffoons, all of them."," It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.", L371419, L371418,m131
" Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am."," And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.", L371421, L371420,m131
 Frank..., Don't stop now! Please..., L371433, L371432,m131
 Wait a second..., I can't... couldn't., L371435, L371434,m131
 Is that liquor?, Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?, L371106, L371105,m131
 Give us this day our daily...," You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?", L371121, L371120,m131

 I was just asking..., Shut up or I'll tear you apart., L371448, L371447,m131
" If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.", A football game?, L371778, L371777,m131
 Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia., But what about Major Houlihan?, L371780, L371779,m131
 You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.," N-n-no thanks, G-General.", L371782, L371781,m131
" The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!", You willing to b-back that up with odds?, L371827, L371826,m131
 Gimme three.," At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.", L371720, L371719,m131
" You betcher ass, Dad.", What?, L371722, L371721,m131
 Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.," You betcher ass, General.", L371726, L371725,m131
" I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not."," I want to talk to you, Pierce.", L371734, L371733,m131
" Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?"," Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.", L371740, L371739,m131
" Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?", Right., L371742, L371741,m131
 And there it is.," I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.", L371745, L371744,m131
" Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.", We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself., L371755, L371754,m131
 I think I heard about that., Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets., L371757, L371756,m131
 Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...," I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.", L371759, L371758,m131
 I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?, Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy., L371452, L371451,m131
 A-negative. I've cross-matched it., I though you said we didn't have a drop., L371684, L371683,m131
 Radar!, All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end., L371837, L371836,m131
 What for?, We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out., L371891, L371890,m131
" Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.", C-A-M-E-M...?, L371893, L371892,m131
" B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow."," Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.", L371895, L371894,m131
 I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?," If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?", L371183, L371182,m131
 That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home., I like an olive., L371188, L371187,m131
 Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.," He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?", L371193, L371192,m131

 ...But I turned in my knee pads.," Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.", L371218, L371217,m131
 Black capsule.," The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.", L371263, L371262,m131
 We're throwing him a Last Supper. We came to invite you., The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out., L371273, L371272,m131
 Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave., An eternal damnation., L371281, L371280,m131
 We stand behind all our work., You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving., L371298, L371297,m131
 It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs., And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish., L371304, L371303,m131
" Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you."," No, no, that one.", L371416, L371415,m131
" I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up."," As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice.", L371474, L371473,m131
 I'm not so sure the goddam thing's in his heart.," 'Course it isn't, but how many chances do we get to go to Japan? With our golf clubs.", L371486, L371485,m131
 Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle., But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?, L371490, L371489,m131
" But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf."," So let's haul ass, Sergeant.", L371495, L371494,m131
 Look., Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive., L371498, L371497,m131
" Don't worry, son. That's Captain McIntyre, and he's the best chest surgeon in the Far East and maybe in the whole U.S. Army. He'll fix you up fine. Your daddy saw to that."," Just like we thought, it's a routine problem. Nurse, who's in charge of operating room preparations?", L371512, L371511,m131
 Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?," Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.", L371528, L371527,m131
" Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal."," And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.", L371556, L371555,m131
" Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.", I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie., L371565, L371564,m131
 Is he out?, Like the Rock of Gibraltar., L371592, L371591,m131
 Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time., Radar!, L371648, L371647,m131
" For you, Trapper."," Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?", L371655, L371654,m131
 It's in pretty deep.," Yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood. I'm afraid it's hit more that just the lung.", L371657, L371656,m131
" Christ, it's Ho-Jon!"," Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!", L371661, L371660,m131

" Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad."," You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.", L371670, L371669,m131
 I don't feel anything.," Oh, Jesus.", L371675, L371674,m131
 I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in., I don't get it., L371677, L371676,m131
 It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery., What do we do?, L371679, L371678,m131
 We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side., Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?, L371681, L371680,m131
 It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?, They're coming., L371709, L371708,m131
 But he's got five times the man-power to draw on., We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones., L371763, L371762,m131
 He only lasted one season., On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him., L371768, L371767,m131
 So what makes you think he'll play for us?, We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college., L371772, L371771,m131
" Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.", He can move in here with us., L371774, L371773,m131
 But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good., Not necessarily., L371802, L371801,m131
" Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?"," Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?", L371373, L371372,m131
" Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine."," I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.", L371375, L371374,m131
 All of them?, That's right. We work well together., L371377, L371376,m131
 Major Burns is far from satisfied.," That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.", L371379, L371378,m131
" On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army."," And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.", L371381, L371380,m131
 I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.', It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but..., L371383, L371382,m131
 That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.," Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.", L371385, L371384,m131
 I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.," Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.", L371387, L371386,m131
" Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures you promised to look at of my kids. You too, Wilma. It won't take a minute.  You can see them too, if you want."," No, thank you. I'm not the slightest bit interested.", L371711, L371710,m131
" Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?"," Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...", L371789, L371788,m131
 The bastards outconned us., I think we could still have a chance., L371796, L371795,m131
" If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?"," No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.", L371798, L371797,m131
 What's the matter?," We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.", L371831, L371830,m131
 See you., It's possible, L371883, L371882,m131
" Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.", There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you..., L371066, L371065,m131
" Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.", No trouble at all.  Hawkeye., L371068, L371067,m131
 How did you get called that?, 'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read., L371070, L371069,m131
" You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.", It isn't always this rough?, L371072, L371071,m131
" Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.", They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together..., L371074, L371073,m131
 Our minds?," For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...", L371076, L371075,m131
 You're an attractive man., You have a certain modest charm yourself., L371078, L371077,m131
 But I'm married., Something else we have in common., L371080, L371079,m131
 Very happily married., Same here., L371082, L371081,m131
" And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?"," It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.", L371084, L371083,m131
 I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men., Ayuh., L371086, L371085,m131
" You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.", Of course not., L371088, L371087,m131
 It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.," Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?", L371090, L371089,m131
 Even if I weren't., Maria..., L371165, L371164,m131
 I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow., You're leaving tomorrow?, L371308, L371307,m131
 In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way., That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby., L371310, L371309,m131
" Dear, sweet Hawkeye.", Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband., L371312, L371311,m131

" As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.", Anything else?, L532806, L532805,m190
" Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.", Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?, L532808, L532807,m190
" Good evening, Sergeants.  A bit dank in here, isn't it?... Where is the Baracken-Fuehrer?"," Yes, sir.", L533260, L533259,m190

" Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?", And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler., L533157, L533156,m190
" It's not Schulz. It's that stoolie. Whoever he is, he's sure batting a thousand."," The guy I want to talk to is Sefton. Where's Sefton?  You haven't seen Sefton, have you?", L533199, L533198,m190
 What are you going to do?, I want everybody out of here. We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound., L533493, L533492,m190
" I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy."," Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.", L533502, L533501,m190
" Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?", Good., L533504, L533503,m190
 What about Schulz?, We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on., L533514, L533513,m190

" What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.", You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine., L533557, L533556,m190
 Why the south latrine?, Because that's where he is. In the water tank., L533559, L533558,m190
" Los, los. Dummkopf!"," Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.", L532762, L532761,m190

" What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.", Says who?, L533025, L533024,m190

" What happened, Cookie? Who did it?", We did it., L533248, L533247,m190
" What's it add up to you, Sefton?", It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy., L533257, L533256,m190
" You heard that, Sefton?", Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear., L533322, L533321,m190

 Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound., You starting that again?, L533562, L533561,m190
" Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?", That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?, L533570, L533569,m190
" Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --"," I called it the last time, didn't I?", L533572, L533571,m190

" Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud.

 And what's that crack supposed to mean?, They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come., L532907, L532906,m190
 When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob., They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio., L533030, L533029,m190
 So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson., What about the radio?, L533251, L533250,m190
" Or how about a game of pinochle? No, you're not a pinochle man. You're a chess player.  I haven't played since I was a kid. Let's see --  -- a pawn moves this way, doesn't it?

 I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.," With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.", L607890, L607889,m218

 What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours., We can't worry about everything right now.

 The other thing is..., ...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs., L607408, L607407,m218
 They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.," We got a bunch of smart guys. We lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options.", L607410, L607409,m218

 And?, And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey., L608028, L608027,m218
 The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --," -- Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I told you how stupid it was to float the Lippman article! But you wouldn't listen to me. What if there hasn't been a coup at all? What if it's you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade?", L608030, L608029,m218
" All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. Okay? You happy? So now what?", So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution., L608034, L608033,m218
 We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?, Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else., L608079, L608078,m218

 What did you think of Lippman's column this morning?, I think it's a bad idea., L607801, L607800,m218

" I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson."," So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?", L607935, L607934,m218
 That is correct., This is from the Highest Authority?, L607937, L607936,m218
 Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.," And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.", L607939, L607938,m218
 And the second condition?, Time is of the essence., L607941, L607940,m218

 You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support.," They want this fucking job, they can have it. It's no great joy to me.", L607582, L607581,m218

 That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...," Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.", L607630, L607629,m218

" He's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2. The Soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them.", And we can't purge the Chiefs. Our invasion talk will look like a bluff. Or even that there's been an attempted coup., L607796, L607795,m218
 What's that?," Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba.", L607813, L607812,m218

" We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.", And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it., L608058, L608057,m218
 Moving the line. Stroke of genius., Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually., L607774, L607773,m218
 You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.," Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --", L607777, L607776,m218
" -- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --", You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me., L607779, L607778,m218
 At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.," And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.", L608062, L608061,m218
" Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...", Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same., L607906, L607905,m218
" That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.", That may be what they want us to think., L607908, L607907,m218
" My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev. Last night's letter was.  The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight.", Jesus Christ..., L607966, L607965,m218

" Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?"," I'm afraid not, Mr. President. The sub has positioned itself between the Pierce and the Soviet ships.

The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through.

 Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?, There is no reason to assume other people were involved., L29068, L29067,m239

So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, ""Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?""  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?", I think so., L29667, L29666,m239

 What else have you got?," According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me.

 Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.," Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't.

 I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel --, No shit., L48096, L48095,m247

 Did you know him very well?, You get to know each other pretty well out there., L48563, L48562,m247
 And you admired him?, He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --, L48565, L48564,m247
" Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.", You knew him best., L48567, L48566,m247
" You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --"," Yes, I know...", L48569, L48568,m247
 I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him..., Both of us..., L48571, L48570,m247
 Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...," His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.", L48573, L48572,m247
" Were you with him, when...", Yes I was... He said his last words to me., L48575, L48574,m247
 Maybe he'll get tubed., What?, L47914, L47913,m247
 What's that?, Just something I read in the Free Press., L47920, L47919,m247
 He'll kill us., He can't kill us.  We're on his side., L47935, L47934,m247
 Are you finished surfing?, Yeah... thanks., L47954, L47953,m247
 Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?, Nah., L47956, L47955,m247
" No -- no, Captain.", Which one's the Colonel's?, L47959, L47958,m247
" This one , Lance?"," Yeah, Jesus Christ !", L47963, L47962,m247
 Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater., He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down., L47967, L47966,m247
 You hear it again?, No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back., L47974, L47973,m247
 You think he'd of shot us?, When?, L47976, L47975,m247
 I don't think he'd of shot us on the beach but -- he'd of shot us if he saw me taking the board --, A Yater spoon is hard to get -- especially here., L47979, L47978,m247
 Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?, Sure., L47984, L47983,m247
 And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?," It's a feeling you get in the jungle. When you get good, you can find a track and tell not only how many they are, but their morale, how far they're going, whether they're near their camp, the weapons they're carrying.", L47986, L47985,m247
 What's this tiger shit?, No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him., L48014, L48013,m247
 You think?, I wasn't looking.. I was running., L48016, L48015,m247
 The other one --, No -- leave it --, L48360, L48359,m247
 What?," Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.", L48427, L48426,m247
 Captain Willard?, That's me., L48121, L48120,m247
" You don't know how happy that makes me, sir.", Why?, L48124, L48123,m247
 Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out., We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?, L48126, L48125,m247
" I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --", What is this bridge?, L48128, L48127,m247
 This boat's a mess., Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him., L48408, L48407,m247
" Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.", Why did they attack us?, L48410, L48409,m247
 Simple. They don't want him to go., You're Australian?, L48412, L48411,m247
" Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.", So Kurtz is alive., L48414, L48413,m247
" But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'", Why didn't he shoot you?, L48417, L48416,m247
 Sounds like he's gone crazy.," No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.", L48422, L48421,m247
 Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.," Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...", L48424, L48423,m247
 Right on -- he's been waiting for --, And shut up., L48429, L48428,m247
 Who are you?, His name is..., L48431, L48430,m247
 May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?," We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.", L48300, L48299,m247
" You must realize, Captain -- we have lost much here -- I, my husband. Gaston -- his wife and son.", I'm sorry to hear that., L48309, L48308,m247
 Cognac?, I should be checking on the boat., L48311, L48310,m247
" Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?", No. Not really., L48315, L48314,m247
 What will you do after the war?," I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.", L48318, L48317,m247
 What's a big question?, Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him., L48320, L48319,m247
 Yes., What did you hear?, L48322, L48321,m247
" That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.", What things?, L48324, L48323,m247
" Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.", Yes., L48326, L48325,m247
" Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages?", I know., L48328, L48327,m247
" Are you warm, Captain?", The river is beautiful., L48332, L48331,m247
 I'm afraid I won't have time -- I gotta --," Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two M-16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order.", L48337, L48336,m247
 So that's it.," You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much.", L48339, L48338,m247
 What if I say no., Then Philippe will have to kill all of you., L48341, L48340,m247
" I don't know anything about these papers, sir.", They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said., L47748, L47747,m247
" Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?", Right now -- I am., L47750, L47749,m247
 Well who the hell verifies that ?, I do., L47752, L47751,m247
 What show ?, Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --, L47756, L47755,m247
 This -- Bob Hope or the like --," No sir, I think -- this'll be a little bit different --", L47758, L47757,m247
" That's 27, sir.", Anyone got a card?, L47889, L47888,m247
 Soldier -- where''s your C.O.?," Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --", L48034, L48033,m247
" Well , who's in command here?", I don't know -- don't have any idea -- I'm just the night man --, L48036, L48035,m247
" You came right to it, son of a bitch --"," Son of a bitch, sir.", L48137, L48136,m247
 Where's your chief supply officer?, Beverly Hills --, L48139, L48138,m247
 What?, Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be?, L48141, L48140,m247
 You come all the way down here to roust--," I came all the way down here same as you did.  Keep from gettin' killed. Happened to see those jarheads beatin' on a good collar--  Habla Ingles, Tomas?", L86950, L86949,m270
 Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In three years I'll be working Central Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters. Promised me the next spot he can wangle., Impressive., L86952, L86951,m270
 Whatta we do about the Mex?, We'll take 'em in the morning., L86955, L86954,m270
 <i>You'll</i> take him.," He's half yours, partner.", L86957, L86956,m270
 He's all yours. And I'm not your partner., Someday., L86959, L86958,m270
 Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes., The strike is a success, L98951, L98950,m277
 But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ..., And you believe the NLF?, L98956, L98955,m277
 They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.," The UN is far away, dear sir. It is easier to make oneself heard with bombs. If I were in their place, I would use bombs.", L98958, L98957,m277
" Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?", The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa., L99031, L99030,m277
 It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war, Dien Bien Phu?, L98962, L98961,m277
" In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.", And here?, L98965, L98964,m277
" Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names", I understand. What's your question?, L99033, L99032,m277
" The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ..."," Let's try to be precise then. The word ""torture"" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?", L99035, L99034,m277
" The law is often inconvenient, colonel ..."," And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer ""yes,"" then you must accept all the necessary consequences.", L99037, L99036,m277
" Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything from the beginning, and then we'll let you go. Name ...", Sid Ahmed., L98983, L98982,m277
 Second name., Sail., L98985, L98984,m277
" Which ""district"" do you belong to?", Second district ..., L98987, L98986,m277
 Second district ... Explain better ...," Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.", L98989, L98988,m277
" What ""group""?", Third group., L98991, L98990,m277
 Third group. What's your assignment?, Uh ... responsible for the sixth section., L98993, L98992,m277
 You afraid of these ...?," Don't move, Hacene.", L98753, L98752,m277
" Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?", It's true., L98755, L98754,m277
 What's happened to you?, The NLF has condemned you to death., L98757, L98756,m277
 How much are they paying you?, They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice, L98761, L98760,m277
 What ... What must I decide?," You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!", L98763, L98762,m277
 With an unloaded pistol?, I'll explain., L98718, L98717,m277
" Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...", Sure. By shooting at me., L98720, L98719,m277
" Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...", I don't even know your name yet ..., L98722, L98721,m277
 But I haven't shot him., You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried., L98725, L98724,m277
 What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing., C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back., L98727, L98726,m277
 I don't do that kind of thing., Then don't complain., L98729, L98728,m277
 You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.," Because we aren't ready yet for the French. Before attacking, we must have safe places from which to depart and find refuge. Of course, there is the Casbah. But even the Casbah isn't safe yet. There are too many drunks, pushers, whores, addicts, spies ... people who talk too much ... people who are ready to sell themselves, undecided people. We must either convince them or eliminate them. We must think of ourselves first. We must clean out the Casbah first. Only then will we be able to deal with the French. Do you understand, Ali?", L98731, L98730,m277
 And how many are we?, Not enough., L98733, L98732,m277
 Why? Isn't he sleeping here?," No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.", L98904, L98903,m277
" It's better to split up, to increase our chances. We must change hiding places, and change them continually ... In the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--"," Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.", L99011, L99010,m277
 Of course. As soon as possible.," No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...", L99013, L99012,m277
 Go away!, Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries ..., L98690, L98689,m277
 Can you read?, Sure ..., L98697, L98696,m277
 Read it., Here?, L98699, L98698,m277
 Where's Kader?, With the others. They are trying to stop the people., L98828, L98827,m277
" Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...", Let's try ..., L98914, L98913,m277
 It's good nobody is following us ..., It's a question of habit ..., L98916, L98915,m277
" What do you think of the strike, Ali?", I think it'll be a success ..., L98920, L98919,m277
 It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.," No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more", L98923, L98922,m277
 No ..., But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike., L98925, L98924,m277
" No, and neither were my men.", Why?, L98927, L98926,m277
" Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right."," That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...", L98929, L98928,m277
" To show them to the UN, right?"," Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.", L98931, L98930,m277
 Good evening ... Can we pass?, It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible., L98807, L98806,m277
 But it's not even midnight yet!, It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight., L98809, L98808,m277
" Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.", I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Tonight is out of the question., L98811, L98810,m277
 Where were we?," Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...", L98771, L98770,m277
" Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow."," Good evening, sir.", L98790, L98789,m277
 Tell me ... Where is this rue de ThΦbes?," Rue de ThΦbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...", L98792, L98791,m277
" All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere."," Good evening, sir.", L98794, L98793,m277
" Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...", A name?, L98890, L98889,m277
" And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers everything should be over."," Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.", L99122, L99121,m277
" Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the only country in the world ..."," Why, yes, of course ... But for the moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! In the mountains our work is always easier.", L99127, L99126,m277
 Why?," For many months, I've had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you ... And naturally, I am under the illusion that I know you somewhat. You never seemed the type, Kader, inclined to performing useless actions.", L99075, L99074,m277
 You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ..., Of course I am., L99077, L99076,m277
 That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.," No. Let's just say that you've given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly. But from the technical point of view, it isn't possible to speak of advantages. By now the game is over. The NLF has been defeated.", L99079, L99078,m277
 What is she saying?, She says that Ali is still in the Casbah., L99081, L99080,m277
 Who is speaking?, Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu., L99046, L99045,m277
" Okay. But we want your promise for a fair trial in writing. Give us a written statement, Mathieu, and then we'll surrender.", How can I give you this statement?, L99050, L99049,m277

" He's going to kill you, Aramis."," Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong.", L367655, L367654,m429
 But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned., Who?, L367672, L367671,m429
 D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky., We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up., L367717, L367716,m429
 Can we eat... before we go?  This excitement's given me an appetite., Bread and wine... in that cupboard., L367835, L367834,m429
" D'Artagnan.  Perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway."," He is right, d'Artagnan.", L367879, L367878,m429
 He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day., Who does?, L367429, L367428,m429
 What do we do now?," I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.", L367432, L367431,m429
" D'Artagnan, unready?"," At a ball, everyone watches the King!", L367670, L367669,m429
" ""Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes.  That should give you ample time.  Never have I needed more to say:  One for all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan.""", He lures us to capture., L367838, L367837,m429
" What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.", You are right.  But it is a trap., L367845, L367844,m429
 It worked!," It's a prison, you idiot!  They don't expect anyone to try getting in!  The problem will come when we want out!", L367852, L367851,m429
 Do I look all right?, None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you., L367113, L367112,m429
 I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused..., Perhaps this will help., L367115, L367114,m429
 Mother's ring.  I can't take this., She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves., L367117, L367116,m429
" That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!"," Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.", L367219, L367218,m429
 But -- are you sure?," We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.", L367221, L367220,m429
 Michelle cannot possibly accept!," She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.", L367223, L367222,m429
 Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?," Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.", L367225, L367224,m429
 Die?  What...?," I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.", L367227, L367226,m429

" I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it."," Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?", L367212, L367211,m429
 They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today., Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?, L367214, L367213,m429
 I heard your playing.," I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.", L367216, L367215,m429
" This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!", If the young woman truly loves Raoul --, L367234, L367233,m429
 You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came., I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope., L367237, L367236,m429
" What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --", I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting., L367239, L367238,m429

 Where are you going?, To kill the king., L367350, L367349,m429
" Athos!  I know life means nothing to you at this moment, but I will not let you kill yourself.", The King killed my son!, L367352, L367351,m429
" It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!", An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!, L367408, L367407,m429
" Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!", No man is all bad... or all good.  I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can help him., L367410, L367409,m429

 He lies.  He is here to trap us., I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself., L367861, L367860,m429

 Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.," There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?", L367562, L367561,m429
 The desire for vengeance... can be a poison., What is its antidote?, L367564, L367563,m429
 You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?, It is something I have done -- or did not do., L367567, L367566,m429
 What is that?, I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with., L367569, L367568,m429
" I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.", I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either., L367611, L367610,m429
" I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --", No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!, L367624, L367623,m429
 Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?, How did you know -- ?, L367626, L367625,m429
 These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle., Whose rooms are those?, L367662, L367661,m429

 Are you hungry?, Just... water., L367469, L367468,m429

" A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, ""What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?""  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.", And you never knew why?, L367474, L367473,m429
 The old man and woman called me... Phillippe., Phillippe.  Rest now., L367478, L367477,m429
 Your Majesty...," What is it, d'Artagnan?  Assassins falling from the sky now?", L367150, L367149,m429
 The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me., I decided it this morning., L367152, L367151,m429
 Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --," I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!", L367154, L367153,m429
 But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --," Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us behave as if my wish is law.  And my wish is to enjoy this party!", L367156, L367155,m429
" Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death!"," It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.", L367277, L367276,m429
" I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow."," Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.", L367279, L367278,m429

 Betrothed?  I think not.," In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love.", L367283, L367282,m429
 Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here., Your Majesty has had many women --, L367285, L367284,m429
" That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!", It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?, L367287, L367286,m429
" What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me."," There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.", L367289, L367288,m429

 Who was Athos seeking?  Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace?, ... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way., L367370, L367369,m429

 My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy., Of course., L396651, L396650,m446
 I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble., I see., L396653, L396652,m446

" Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions."," Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford.

And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead."," There's to be a bright side, look for it.", L482909, L482908,m502
" Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.", There's always a bright side., L482911, L482910,m502
" I'm listening, sir."," Well, I, for one, like cheese.", L482913, L482912,m502
" General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain."," Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.", L482961, L482960,m502
" Jesus Christ, he's a natural!"," Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?", L483029, L483028,m502
" Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?"," Sure, what do you want to know?", L483088, L483087,m502
" Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?", Ours is not to reason why., L483090, L483089,m502
 Huh?," Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.", L483092, L483091,m502
" I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing."," Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.", L483094, L483093,m502
" Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers."," You have orders, too.", L483101, L483100,m502
" Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.  Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers.  Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you.  How long you been in the army?"," I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.  But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say?", L483117, L483116,m502
" In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance."," Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.", L483120, L483119,m502
 Any further thoughts on the subject?," Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.", L483124, L483123,m502
" Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.", We can't leave it here., L483189, L483188,m502

 Up.  We're moving out.," I thought you said we had an hour, sir?", L483299, L483298,m502
" I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.", Why's that?, L483312, L483311,m502
" Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive."," Except for the last part, that one's not bad.", L483314, L483313,m502
" B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.", I don't like that one., L483316, L483315,m502
" Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.", But we accomplish the mission., L483318, L483317,m502
" Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division."," Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?", L483320, L483319,m502
" No, sir.", That's a mystery to me., L483322, L483321,m502

" You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules."," Have it your way, Captain.", L483346, L483345,m502
" Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir."," You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?", L483391, L483390,m502

" Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again."," As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.", L483019, L483018,m502

 Who warned you?, Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels., L568247, L568246,m548
 What did Goering say?, He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word., L568249, L568248,m548
 It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again., Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you., L568387, L568386,m548

I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics.

" I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost."," And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?", L568401, L568400,m548
 What telegram?," 'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'", L568403, L568402,m548

" We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor."," You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity.

 That's an outrageous lie!," You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?", L568428, L568427,m548

And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck.

He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard.

 It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing..., Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?, L598286, L598285,m565
 It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.," But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.", L598288, L598287,m565
" Well of course they're me!  That's how God talks to me.  If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him."," But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?", L598290, L598289,m565
 All you have to do is stop talking and just listen., But how do you know what you hear is the truth?, L598292, L598291,m565
 I don't know it.  I feel it., You make it sound so simple..., L598294, L598293,m565
" The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated."," Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!", L598296, L598295,m565
 So... even you don't believe in me anymore..., Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone..., L598298, L598297,m565
" If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.", Tell me..., L598301, L598300,m565
 That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?," You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.", L598321, L598320,m565
 What did the king say?, He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and..., L598323, L598322,m565
 It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!, Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months..., L598325, L598324,m565
" No, but...", Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?, L598327, L598326,m565
 Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?, To marry you., L598329, L598328,m565
 I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.," Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!", L598331, L598330,m565
 Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me., I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God., L598333, L598332,m565
 But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?, But it is what I want., L598335, L598334,m565
 To be killed in battle?," If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.", L598337, L598336,m565
 Will you at least let me stay with you?, It would not be the same without you., L598339, L598338,m565
 We must sound the retreat!, Not yet!, L598341, L598340,m565
 Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!, But... why... what's the point?, L598344, L598343,m565
 Do as I say!, I want to stay with you..., L598346, L598345,m565
 I am ready now..., Just give me a moment and then you'll be free..., L598816, L598815,m565
 I'm already free..., Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient..., L598818, L598817,m565
 My gentle Captain... I'm staying., I -- I don't understand..., L598820, L598819,m565
 One day you will.," You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy, and have children, and...", L598822, L598821,m565
" ... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!"," I'm staying, Jean.", L598824, L598823,m565
" No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!", I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me..., L598826, L598825,m565
 Jeanne's alive!, Good., L598076, L598075,m565
 We have to press home the attack!, Sound the retreat..., L598078, L598077,m565
 But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!, I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!, L598080, L598079,m565
 But that was her order!," I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed!  Look at the mess we're in!  That's her mess, not mine...!  We're worse off then if she'd never come at all!  ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!", L598082, L598081,m565
 I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you..., You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!, L598541, L598540,m565
 No..., Did God forbid you to tell the truth?, L598543, L598542,m565
 Go onto the next question.," Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?", L598563, L598562,m565
 Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?, I tried to., L598615, L598614,m565
" It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?", I don't remember.  Maybe., L598617, L598616,m565
 Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?, I don't know..., L598619, L598618,m565
 And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?," No... I said ""Surrender in the name of the King of France""...", L598621, L598620,m565
 I can't read.," Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?", L598624, L598623,m565
 Do you have a sword?, Quite a few., L598642, L598641,m565
 Didn't you also carry a banner?, Yes..., L598644, L598643,m565
" Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?", I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword., L598646, L598645,m565
 And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?," No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.", L598648, L598647,m565
 And?, And so I... I prefer my banner., L598650, L598649,m565
 Why?, To avoid killing anyone., L598652, L598651,m565
" No, of course not... I never killed anyone...", Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?, L598655, L598654,m565
 No!  I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?, We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner..., L598657, L598656,m565
" Yes, probably... maybe...", So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?, L598659, L598658,m565
" Yes, but...", Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?, L598661, L598660,m565
" No, I... I held it up to...", You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?, L598663, L598662,m565
" Yes, maybe... I don't remember..."," ... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?", L598665, L598664,m565
" It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop?"," Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...", L598213, L598212,m565
 I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it..., And when was that?, L598228, L598227,m565
 Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI..., Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone..., L598230, L598229,m565

" Jeanne, listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own.  We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her.  But we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.  Take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and I think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.  So now... will you please recite Our Lord's Prayer?", Not unless you hear my confession., L598486, L598485,m565
 Jeanne -- be careful -- you're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment...," And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!", L598488, L598487,m565

Moreover this Church, when assembled, is guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore cannot be in error.  That is why we ask you to submit to the Church Militant... that is to say, us."," So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?", L598599, L598598,m565
" It is for us to determine whether you are a good Christian, not you."," I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?", L598601, L598600,m565
" Jeanne, I beg of you... sign!  In God's name, don't you understand? I'm trying to save you!  If you don't sign, the English will burn you to death!  Is that what you want??", No... I want to be confessed., L598781, L598780,m565

" I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!", It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul., L598805, L598804,m565

 Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours., W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?, L597765, L597764,m565
 Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?, You really think she's been sent... by God?, L597767, L597766,m565
 You will??," For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.", L597878, L597877,m565

But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...", L598306, L598305,m565
" Don't worry, Charles.  If God is still with her, she will be victorious.  We're not her judges... we're just spectators.  Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.", But... her army's so small now..., L598315, L598314,m565
" There's no need to be afraid, sire.", I'm... I'm not the king..., L597809, L597808,m565

 So how would you put it?," Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, ""to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace""...", L598273, L598272,m565

 My captains have sworn their support., No doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause -- but what about the ordinary soldier?  They don't fight for causes these days. They fight for money.  Who's going to pay them?, L597875, L597874,m565
 He's probably right -- let's call a delay...," There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...", L598207, L598206,m565
 I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?, Noooo!, L598311, L598310,m565
" When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?"," If there was, I didn't see it...", L598546, L598545,m565
 Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?, Go and ask him yourself., L598548, L598547,m565
 You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it?, His face., L598581, L598580,m565
 Does he have hair?, Yes., L598583, L598582,m565
 Is it long and hanging down?," I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.", L598585, L598584,m565
 But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said?, Go on to the next question., L598587, L598586,m565
" 5,000 gold crowns.", That's not a lot., L598393, L598392,m565
 It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.," I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.", L598395, L598394,m565
" May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?"," 20,000 gold crowns.", L598397, L598396,m565
" 8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.", I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow., L598401, L598400,m565
 Were you sent by Lord Dunois?, Yes... they were., L597929, L597928,m565
 Good.  Where are the English?, Everywhere.  Where is the food?, L597931, L597930,m565
 It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot..., I know..., L597933, L597932,m565
 Good.  Can you bring me to him?, He's on the other side of the river., L597935, L597934,m565
" Wait, wait...", For what?, L597945, L597944,m565
" Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?"," Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!", L597947, L597946,m565
" Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything."," You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!", L597949, L597948,m565
 So... what is the message?," We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace.  If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.", L597971, L597970,m565
" Jeanne, that really makes no sense at all.  The Tourelles is virtually impregnable... besides, if we're on the other side of the river attacking the Tourelles, what's to stop Talbot attacking the city from the north?", God., L597973, L597972,m565
" You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God."," Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...", L597978, L597977,m565
" ""Be patient, be patient""... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!"," Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.", L597982, L597981,m565
" Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl."," Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?", L597984, L597983,m565
 Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!, Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?, L598027, L598026,m565
" Position the long-bows over there, crossbows over there -- and set up Dijon Culverins either side of those trees...", The wind will be against us..., L598039, L598038,m565
 What's going on?, We're taking back the Tourelles!, L598098, L598097,m565
" Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front..."," I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!", L598103, L598102,m565
 Stand by with the battering-rams..., We need another ten minutes..., L598126, L598125,m565
 Well...?  Shall we go?, Not yet., L598190, L598189,m565
 My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!," Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?", L597913, L597912,m565
 The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!," Yes, it's a miracle.", L597915, L597914,m565
 And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...," Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...", L597917, L597916,m565
 But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?," As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.", L597919, L597918,m565
" Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?", That'll put fire in my soldiers!, L597850, L597849,m565
" God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.", Damn right!, L597975, L597974,m565
 I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!, Me too..., L597989, L597988,m565
 There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes!, Yes.  We can pray., L598054, L598053,m565
 This is no good!, No good?  This is a disaster!, L598249, L598248,m565
 And... what does Jeanne think?," I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.", L597969, L597968,m565
" We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.", But the bridge has been pulled down!, L598033, L598032,m565
 Clear?, Perfectly., L598120, L598119,m565
 You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?, No... not like this..., L598158, L598157,m565
" Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?", I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine..., L598174, L598173,m565
 Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?, Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess..., L598182, L598181,m565
 Jeanne... The men are exhausted!," I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!", L598251, L598250,m565
 Jeanne... we're not enough..., So... bring up the reinforcements!, L598253, L598252,m565
 Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!," Jeanne, look behind you.", L598256, L598255,m565
 Do you know how to count?, Of course I do?  Bring them up!, L598259, L598258,m565
 Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers., But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?, L598261, L598260,m565
" He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...", But my voices... they promised me..., L598263, L598262,m565
 Who told you to wear men's clothes?, The clothes are not important..., L598591, L598590,m565
" You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  It proves your desire to deceive...", It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers..., L598593, L598592,m565
 So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?, I... submit to Our Lord., L598595, L598594,m565
 But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?, It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?, L598597, L598596,m565
" Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?", I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands., L598627, L598626,m565
 Did your voice tell you to jump?, No..., L598629, L598628,m565
" So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?", No...!, L598631, L598630,m565
" How can you deny it when you just said ""I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English""...?", That's now what I meant..., L598633, L598632,m565
 Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!," I know, but that's not the way things happened...", L598635, L598634,m565
 You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?," Yes, but...", L598637, L598636,m565
 And you didn't jump of your free will?, No!, L598639, L598638,m565
 Stop it!  What are you doing?, Nothing... just taking his teeth., L598161, L598160,m565
 But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!, Why not?  He has good teeth..., L598163, L598162,m565
" Besides, what about these...?", That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!, L598167, L598166,m565
 Yeah..., Here -- take this instead., L598178, L598177,m565
 So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??," Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!", L597937, L597936,m565
" La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!", Sorry Jeanne...  Did you both meet already?, L597939, L597938,m565
" Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois."," Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...", L597943, L597942,m565
 Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!, They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that., L597952, L597951,m565
 What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?," God knows, but it was a bad idea!", L598023, L598022,m565
" I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...", Don't swear..., L598057, L598056,m565
 Physicians are a waste of time. You'll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt!, I'd sooner die than use magic!, L598066, L598065,m565
 Prepare these as battering-rams!, What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!, L598110, L598109,m565
 We... won?!," Won?!  Such a small word will never do!  This is victory, Jeanne, this is... glory!", L598152, L598151,m565
 You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...," ... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!", L598155, L598154,m565
 Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!, Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous..., L598171, L598170,m565
 Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward.  Let him take a few teeth..., A few teeth... that's the price of his life?, L598176, L598175,m565
" Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up..."," I said, kneel!", L598186, L598185,m565
 You don't believe me anymore?," We still believe in you, Jeanne.  If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean. But it's not up to us anymore -- it's up to the king...", L598266, L598265,m565
" When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?", Yes... a half-steed... white., L598603, L598602,m565
 Who gave you that horse?, My king., L598605, L598604,m565
 How many did he give you?, Five steeds and a few hackneys..., L598607, L598606,m565
 As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?, No., L598609, L598608,m565
 What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?," Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...", L598611, L598610,m565
" Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?"," And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?", L598613, L598612,m565
 Jeanne... what are you doing?, Playing..., L598142, L598141,m565
 What have you done to me?, I -- I -- I..., L598146, L598145,m565
 Who... who are you...?, I am that I am.  You don't like my face?  Maybe you prefer this one..., L598354, L598353,m565
 Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?  Are you God?, No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling..., L598359, L598358,m565
 I don't know... I thought..., YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?, L598362, L598361,m565
 I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead..., WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?, L598364, L598363,m565
 I... don't know... what do you want from me?, Nothing.  I'm here to set you free..., L598366, L598365,m565
 What are you doing out here?, I might ask you the same question., L598415, L598414,m565
 I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore..., And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?, L598417, L598416,m565
 Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!," You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...", L598419, L598418,m565
 I... I never lied!," If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...", L598421, L598420,m565
" I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven.  He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me..."," How can you pretend that you love God when you're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you? Life is a gift, you should know that by now Jeanne -- a gift from God. You know what He'd say to you, if He was here?  ""What are you doing to me, Jeanne?""", L598423, L598422,m565
" That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?"," No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!", L598426, L598425,m565
" Oh?  And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!", I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!, L598428, L598427,m565
" Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?", I don't understand.  What do you want from me?, L598430, L598429,m565
 Why were you yelling like that?!, What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here..., L598508, L598507,m565
 Why?  Are you waiting for someone else?, Yes!, L598510, L598509,m565
 My... visions..., They're going to come and visit you in here?, L598513, L598512,m565
 Yes... that's what I pray for...!, I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you., L598515, L598514,m565
" No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!", Why not?, L598517, L598516,m565
 They won't come anyway.," What do you mean, they won't come?", L598520, L598519,m565
 Why would they?," Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...", L598522, L598521,m565
 God asked you to do something?, Yes... lots of things!, L598524, L598523,m565
" You mean God said, ""I need you, Jeanne?"""," No, but... he sent me so many signs!", L598526, L598525,m565
 What signs?, Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!, L598528, L598527,m565
 No.  That was a sword in a field., But... it didn't just get there by itself., L598530, L598529,m565
" I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!", Oh?  You can't remember?  Let me help your memory..., L598669, L598668,m565
 No!  I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that man!, Oh no?  How about this one?, L598671, L598670,m565
" Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...", So your memory's coming back?, L598674, L598673,m565
" Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's ""the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..."" he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?", Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?, L598676, L598675,m565
" No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?", In His name??, L598678, L598677,m565
 Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!, Really?, L598680, L598679,m565
" ""Let all who love me follow me""... Where does God get mentioned?  Come on Jeanne, be honest.  You fought for yourself, in your name."," I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?", L598683, L598682,m565
" No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?"," No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.", L598685, L598684,m565
 I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?, Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?, L598689, L598688,m565
" Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?", I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?, L598691, L598690,m565
" I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...", What are you doing on the wall?, L598720, L598719,m565
 I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful..., What for?, L598722, L598721,m565
 Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him., Do you think this cross will protect you?, L598724, L598723,m565
" ""Love your enemies""..."," Good.  But ""love your enemies""... body and soul.", L598729, L598728,m565
 My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?, I don't think so., L598731, L598730,m565
 Are you going to leave me too?, Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore., L598733, L598732,m565
 There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now..., Do you think you are ready?, L598739, L598738,m565
 Yes I am., Are you willing to follow all His commandments?, L598741, L598740,m565
 Yes..., ... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?, L598743, L598742,m565
" You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...", No..., L598788, L598787,m565
 You think you are ready now?," Yes, my lord.", L598811, L598810,m565
" You know I'm always happy to see you, Jeanne, but to keep coming here twice, three times a day...", I need to confess., L597648, L597647,m565
 But you already confessed this morning..., I need to confess again., L597650, L597649,m565
 I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.," There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.", L597653, L597652,m565
 They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small., Whose were they?, L597655, L597654,m565
 My father's., I'm sure he'll forgive you., L597657, L597656,m565
" He already did, but I want God to forgive me too."," Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.", L597659, L597658,m565
 Is that bad?," Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?", L597661, L597660,m565
 Oh yes... very., And your mother -- everything's fine with her?, L597663, L597662,m565
" Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?"," Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.", L597666, L597665,m565
 And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?," Oh yes, I play with them... lots...", L597668, L597667,m565
 So... everything sounds... wonderful?," Yes, it is.", L597672, L597671,m565
 Then... why are you here so often?, I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him., L597674, L597673,m565
 Him?," Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.", L597676, L597675,m565
